The VATNZ SOPs Refresh Project is an open-source collaborative project allowing members of the VATNZ community to work together to create high-quality SOPs for the virtual New Zealand FIR.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines can be found within the project under [Assist Us](https://vatnz-dev.github.io/sops/assist-us/). 

**Before contributing** you should liaise with the VATNZ Operations Team to ascertain whether that particular SOP is needed. There is a fine-line between enabling a realistic service, and making our SOPs easy to navigate and understand.

A specific channel for SOP development discussion exists on the VATNZ Discord. Please message the Operations Director to gain access to this channel.

## Build and Deployment

This project uses some basic CI to automatically push the latest commits to the `main` branch to GitHub Pages. 

Because of this, all changes should be made as a Pull Request. This also ensures - 
  * That everybody has visibility of what you're working on, and can provide commit-by-commit commenting and review.
  * A much better method of version control, as most PR's will be squashed and merged into `main`.

## Project Control

The owner for this project is the Operations Director. Members of the Operations Team are also able to review PR's.
