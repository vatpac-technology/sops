# VATPAC SOPs  

The VATPAC SOPs site is an open-source, collaborative project that enables the VATPAC community to develop and maintain high-quality Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  

## Contributing  

Before contributing, you should consult the VATPAC Air Traffic Services (ATS) Team to confirm whether the SOP you intend to create or modify is necessary. There is a balance between enhancing realism and keeping SOPs clear and accessible.  

Contribution guidelines are available under [the Contribute tab](https://vatpac-technology.github.io/sops/assist-us/).  

### Recommended Process  

To avoid unnecessary work, contributors should first raise an issue describing the proposed change or new SOP. This allows for discussion and ensures alignment with operational needs before development begins.  

## Build and Deployment  

This project uses basic Continuous Integration (CI) to automatically deploy updates from the `main` branch to GitHub Pages.  

All changes must be submitted as a Pull Request (PR), ensuring:  

- **Transparency** – Allows others to provide feedback and review changes commit by commit.  
- **Improved version control** – Most PRs will be squashed and merged into `main`.  

## Project Governance  

### Approval Process  

The VATPAC ATS Team is responsible for reviewing all submitted PRs. Changes will not be merged until they receive sufficient approval from the **SOPs Maintainers** group, which consists of senior ATS personnel.  

Ideally, before submitting a PR, contributors should create an issue outlining the proposed change. This helps prevent unnecessary work and ensures that all modifications align with operational requirements.
