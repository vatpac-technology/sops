# VATPAC SOPs

The VATPAC SOPs site is an open-source collaborative project allowing members of the VATPAC community to work together to create high-quality SOPs.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines can be found within the project under [the Contribute tab](https://vatpac-technology.github.io/sops/assist-us/). 

**Before contributing** you should liaise with the VATPAC ATS Team to ascertain whether that particular SOP is needed. There is a fine-line between enabling a realistic service, and making our SOPs easy to navigate and understand.  

### Image/Asset Source Files
All source files used to generate custom-made images or other assets should be saved to the [Image Source Files](https://github.com/vatpac-technology/image-source-files) repo, allowing future edits if necessary.

## Build and Deployment

This project uses some basic CI to automatically push the latest commits to the `main` branch to GitHub Pages. 

Because of this, all changes should be made as a Pull Request. This also ensures - 
  * That everybody has visibility of what you're working on, and can provide commit-by-commit commenting and review.
  * A much better method of version control, as most PR's will be squashed and merged into `main`.

## Project Control

The owner for this project is the ATS Director. Members of the ATS Team are also able to review PR's.

### Approval Process

Members of the ATS Department may review any contributed PRs and request changes or sign off on the work. Merging will not be completed until sufficient approvals have been given by members of the **SOPs Maintainers** group (comprised of senior ATS personnel).
