# VATPAC SOPs

The VATPAC SOPs site is an open-source, collaborative project which allows members of the VATPAC community to develop and maintain high-quality Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

## Contributing

**Before contributing** you should liaise with the VATPAC ATS Team to ascertain whether that particular SOP is needed. There is a fine-line between enabling a realistic service, and making our SOPs easy to navigate and understand.

Ideally, before submitting a PR, contributors should create an issue outlining the proposed change. This helps prevent unnecessary work and ensures that all modifications align with operational requirements. 

Contribution guidelines can be found within the project under [the Contribute tab](https://vatpac-technology.github.io/sops/assist-us/). 

### Image/Asset Source Files
All source files used to generate custom-made images or other assets should be saved to the [Image Source Files](https://github.com/vatpac-technology/image-source-files) repo, allowing future edits if necessary.

## Build and Deployment

This project uses basic Continuous Integration (CI) to automatically deploy updates from the `main` branch to GitHub Pages.  

All changes must be submitted as a Pull Request (PR), ensuring:  

- **Transparency** – Allows others to provide feedback and review changes commit by commit.  
- **Improved version control** – Most PRs will be squashed and merged into `main`.  

## Project Control

The owner for this project is the ATS Director. Members of the ATS Team are also able to review PR's.

### Approval Process

Members of the ATS Department may review any contributed PRs and request changes or sign off on the work. Merging will not be completed until sufficient approvals have been given by members of the **SOPs Maintainers** group (comprised of senior ATS personnel).
