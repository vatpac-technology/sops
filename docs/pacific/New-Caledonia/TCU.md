## Airspace
The vertical limits of the Tontouta TCU are `SFC` to `F245`.

When NWWM ADC is offline, the NWWM CTR (`SFC` to `A015`) reverts to Class G and is administered by the relevant TCU controller.

When NWWWT is online, the TCU is split down the NWWW 11/29 Extended Centreline, with NWWWA owning the northern portion, and NWWWT owning the southern portion.

## Coordination
### NWWW TCU / ENR

#### Departures

Voiceless coordination is in place from NWWW TCU to NWWW/NFFF for aircraft assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL` and tracking via a procedural SID terminus.

Any aircraft not meeting the above requirements must be prior coordinated to NWWW/NFFF.

#### Arrivals

Voiceless coordination is in place from NWWW/NFFF to NWWW TCU given the arrival has been assigned the standard assignable level of `A100` and depending on the duty runway:

|Runway|Requirement|
|------|-----------|
|11|Assigned a STAR|
|29|Tracking to LTO VOR|

All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.

### NWWW TCU / NWWW ADC
#### Auto Release

'Next' coordination is **not** required to from NWWW ADC for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID

### NWWW TCU / NWWM ADC
#### Departures

When the aircraft is ready for departure, NWWM ADC will coordinate with NWWW TCU for permission to release the aircraft into CTA.

The standard assignable level from NWWM ADC to NWWW TCU is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
NWWW TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class D to NWWM ADC prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.
VFR aircraft require a level readback.
