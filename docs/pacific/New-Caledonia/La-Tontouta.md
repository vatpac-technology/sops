## Airspace

NWWW ADC is responsible for the Class D Airspace within the NWWW CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **GOPRA**, **ONIBA**, **TEPAM**, **NISAS**, **POXAK**, **SCUBA**, **VIRAR** or **LTO VOR** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

All other aircraft may be assigned a visual departure.

### Visual Departures

Due to high terrain, only the below directions and/or headings are to be assigned to aircraft departing visually by day only:

| Runway | Direction | Heading |
| ----|----| ---------------|
| 11  |Right| 140째 to 190째 |
| 29  |Left| 290째 to 220째 |

## ATIS
### Approach Expectation

If visual approaches are in operation the APCH field must state `EXP VISUAL APCH`.

If **Runway 11** is in use for arrivals and the cloud base is above `A030` but below `A060`, the APCH field shall also include:  
`ACFT ON THE ALPHA STAR EXP ILS APCH` 

## Coordination
### NWWW TCU
#### Auto Release

'Next' coordination is **not** required to from NWWW ADC for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to NWWW TCU.

The standard assignable level from NWWW ADC to NWWW TCU is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`.
