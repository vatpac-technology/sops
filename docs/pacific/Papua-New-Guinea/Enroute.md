Airspace `SFC` to `BCTA` is considered Class F.

Refer to the [PNG Local instructions](../) for more information about Class F operations.

## Coordination
### AYPY TCU
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from AYPY TCU to AYPM CTR for aircraft assigned the lower of `A150` or the `RFL` and tracking via a procedural SID terminus.

Any aircraft not meeting the above requirements must be prior coordinated to AYPM CTR.

#### Arrivals
Voiceless coordination is in place from AYPM CTR to AYPY TCU given the arrival has been assigned the standard assignable level of `A140` and assigned a STAR.

All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.

### Class F Aerodromes
#### Departures and Arrivals
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#octa-coordination), coordination between ADC and AYPM CTR is **not required**. However, a **5 minute** change parameter applies to any aircraft that change level, route, or taxi within **5 minutes** of the next sector's airspace.

#### Overfliers
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#octa-coordination), coordination between ADC and AYPM CTR is **not required**. However, a **5 minute** change parameter applies to any aircraft that change level, route, or taxi within **5 minutes** of the next sector's airspace.

IFR aircraft may either be handed off to the ADC frequency by AYPM CTR, or held on the AYPM CTR frequency following coordination if there is no relevant traffic.

!!! phraseology
    *DEF tracking YABAL H409 PAPTI*  
    <span class="hotline">**AYPM CTR** -> **AYMH ADC**</span>: "via LEMER, DEF, overflying at `A180`."  
    <span class="hotline">**AYMH ADC** -> **AYPM CTR**</span>: "DEF, No reported traffic, no frequency requirements."  
    AYPM CTR will put *"AYMH NFR"* in the label data, and the aircraft will remain on the ENR frequency.

### International (ARA)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.
    
### Pacific Oceanic (TSN(COL)/KZAK)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.

Aircraft must have their identification terminated and be instructed to make a position report on first contact with the next (procedural) sector.

!!! phraseology
    **AYPM CTR**: "SOL712, identification terminated, report position to Brisbane Radio, 124.65"

### International (WAAF)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#other-units), Heads-up Coordination required for all aircraft prior to **30 mins** from boundary.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="coldline">**AYPM CTR** -> **WAAF CTR**</span>: "Estimate, ANG8, KADAB time 59, F380"  
    <span class="coldline">**WAAF CTR** -> **AYPM CTR**</span>: "ANG8, F380"
