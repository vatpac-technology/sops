!!! phraseology
    *DEF tracking LUNTO H789 ESNIV H652 WK*  
    <span class="hotline">**AYPM** -> **AYTK ADC**</span>: "via ESNIV, DEF, any traffic or frequency requirements?"  
    <span class="hotline">**AYTK ADC** -> **AYPM**</span>: "DEF, No reported IFR traffic, no frequency requirements."  
    AYPM CTR will put *"AYTK NFR NIT"* in the label data, and the aircraft will remain on the ENR frequency.
