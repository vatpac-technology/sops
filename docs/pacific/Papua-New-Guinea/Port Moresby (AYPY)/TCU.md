When activated, the airspace is administered by AYPYA. Aircraft will be cleared to enter the Training Area via the **GPS Approach** and advised to report overhead `DGOWH` after conducting the mandatory missed approach.

<!--## Departure/Arrival Procedures
## Tower Offline Procedures
## Runway Modes --->
## Parallel Runway Operations
Simultaneous parallel runway operations, including PROPS and SODROPS, are not authorised at AYPY. Arrivals for parallel runways should be sequenced so that their approaches are not simultaneous and separation is maintained.

## Coordination
### Enroute
#### Departures
Voiceless for aircraft:
- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus^; and
- Assigned the lower of `A150` or the `RFL`.

!!! note
    ^Aircraft are *not required* to be tracking via the **SID procedure**, simply tracking via any of the terminus waypoints (Regardless of *departure airport* or *assigned SID*) is sufficient to meet the criteria for **voiceless coordination**

All other aircraft going to AYPM CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated by AYPYA prior to the boundary.

#### Arrivals
Voiceless coordination for all aircraft:
- With ADES **AYPY**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A140`.

All other aircraft coming from AYPM CTA must be **Heads-up** coordinated to AYPYA.

### AYPY ADC
#### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required from AYPY ADC for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID.

#### Overfliers
AYPYA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from AYPYA to AYPY ADC prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.
VFR aircraft require a level readback.
