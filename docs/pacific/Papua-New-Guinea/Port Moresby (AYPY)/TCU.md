## Coordination
### Enroute

#### Departures

Voiceless coordination is in place from AYPY TCU to AYPM for aircraft assigned the lower of `A150` or the `RFL` and tracking via a procedural SID terminus.

Any aircraft not meeting the above requirements must be prior coordinated to AYPM.

#### Arrivals

Voiceless coordination is in place from AYPM to AYPY TCU given the arrival has been assigned the standard assignable level of `A140` and assigned a STAR.

All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.

### AYPY ADC
#### Auto Release

'Next' coordination is **not** required from AYPY ADC for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID

#### Overfliers
AYPY TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from AYPY Class C to AYPY ADC prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.
VFR aircraft require a level readback.
