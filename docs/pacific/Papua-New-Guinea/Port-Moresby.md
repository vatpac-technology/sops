## Airspace

AYPY ADC is responsible for the Class C Airspace within the AYPY CTR `SFC` to `A020`.

## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **GUNKI**, **LOTGU**, **NUPTA**, **ODOGA**, **RUVKI**, **STARF**, **TOMOM** or **UNSAM** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

All other aircraft may be assigned a visual departure.

## ATIS
### Approach Expectation

If visual approaches are in operation the APCH field must state `EXP VISUAL APCH`.

## Coordination
### AYPY TCU
#### Auto Release

'Next' coordination is **not** required to AYPY TCU for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to AYPY TCU.

The standard assignable level from AYPY ADC to AYPY TCU is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`.
