### Departures and Arrivals
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#octa-coordination), coordination between AYTK ADC and AYPM is **not required**. However, a **5 minute** change parameter applies to any aircraft that change level, route, or taxi within **5 minutes** of the next sector's airspace.

However, a **5 minute** change parameter applies to any aircraft that change level, route, or taxi within **5 minutes** of the next sector's airspace.

IFR aircraft may either be handed off to AYTK ADC frequency by AYPM, or held on the AYPM frequency following coordination if there is no relevant traffic.

!!! phraseology
    *DEF tracking LUNTO H789 ESNIV H652 WK*  
    <span class="hotline">**AYPM** -> **AYTK ADC**</span>: "via ESNIV, DEF, any traffic or frequency requirements?"  
    <span class="hotline">**AYTK ADC** -> **AYPM**</span>: "DEF, No reported IFR traffic, no frequency requirements."  
    AYPM CTR will put *"AYTK NFR NIT"* in the label data, and the aircraft will remain on the ENR frequency.
