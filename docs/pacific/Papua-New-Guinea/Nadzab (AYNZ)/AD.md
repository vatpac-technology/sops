## Airspace
AYNZ ADC is responsible for the Class C Airspace within the AYNZ CTR `SFC` to `A060`.

## Maneuvering Area
### Responsibility
### Standard Taxi Routes
### Taxiway Restrictions--->
## Separation
### Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the AYNZ CTR. Although AYNZ ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, AYPM may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination.

### Lateral Separation Points
The Markham River runs East-West through the AYNZ CTR south of the Runway 09/27 centreline.

Its prominence and location makes it a convenient option to implement a [geographic feature separation standard](../../../separation-standards/visual/#geographic-features).

## Local Procedures
### Standard Departure Clearances
In lieu of a SID, departing aircraft may be issued with a **Standard Departure Clearance** (SDC). Aircraft cleared via an SDC will depart the circuit visually, and then intercept the track specified by five miles. 

AYNZ ADC will clear relevant departures via the appropriate coded SDC, write the departure name in the Global Ops Field.

!!! phraseology
    **AYNZ ADC:** "...cleared to Guam via Departure 35 then PIKOK flight planned route..." 

A list of the Standard Departure Clearances is available in the [AIP Flight Supplement](#charts).

## SID Selection
There are no SIDs at AYNZ. In **VMC by day**, all aircraft shall be assigned a **visual departure**. 

Otherwise:
- IFR aircraft departing via **MUDIX** shall be assigned the **GOROKA 1** or **GOROKA 2** **DME departure**.
- IFR aircraft departing via **LARID** shall be assigned the **LAE** **DME departure**.
- IFR aircraft not departing via **MUDIX** or **LARID** should be assigned an [SDC](#standard-departure-clearances) and/or sector **DME departure**.

## Coordination
### Departures
[Next](../../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from AYNZ ADC to AYNZA for all aircraft **entering AYNZA CTA**.

The Standard Assignable Level from **AYNZ ADC** to **AYNZA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A050` and `RFL` |
   
#### Arrivals
AYNZA will **heads-up** coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to AYNZ ADC.

- Aircraft on an instrument approach will be cleared for the approach prior to handoff to AYNZ ADC, unless AYNZ ADC nominates a restriction.
- Aircraft on a visual approach will be coordinated, but will receive their approach clearance and circuit joining instructions from AYNZ ADC.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**AYNZA** -> **AYNZ ADC**</span>: "Via LARID for the RNAV, PXB.‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**AYNZ ADC** -> **AYNZA**</span>: "PXB."
