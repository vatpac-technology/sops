## Tower/Ground

### Apron
ATC is not responsible for aircraft operations on aprons, parking areas or any other area that is outside the manoeuvring area. Therefore, contrary to popular belief an ATC clearance is not required to operate in these areas. ATC helps by providing traffic information about other aircraft entering or leaving the same apron or parking area. `AIP ENR 1.1`

### Manoevering Area
ATC responsibility for collision avoidance covers the parts of the aerodrome used for the take-off, landing and taxiing of aircraft, excluding aprons and parking areas. This is known as the manoeuvring area and is defined in `AIP GEN 2.2.`

On the manoeuvring area, it is a joint pilot-controller responsibility to avoid a collision. 

### Runway Operations

Do not clear an aircraft for take off until the preceding departure is airborne and has:

- passed the upwind threshold of the runway;
- commenced a turn; 
- reached a point at least 1800M (6000FT) along the runway (subject to wake turbulence and enroute sequencing considerations).

Do not clear an aircraft for take off until the preceding arrival has vacated the runway and don't clear an aircraft to take off or land until a departing aircraft on the crossing runway has crossed the intersection, or an arriving aircraft has either crossed the intersection or landed and stopped short of the intersection.

### 2400m Reduced Runway Separation Minima
The standard allows for two aircraft to occupy the runway at one time, provided the lead aircraft has a MTOW of 7,000KG or more, and environmental conditions support normal approaches, good visibility and good braking characteristics. The lead aircraft must remain in motion and vacate the runway without backtracking. The following aircraft may be any weight or category but wake turbulence separation must still be applied between the aircraft. Traffic information will be provided to the following aircraft, for example: `VOZ123 TRAFFIC IS AN A330 ON THE RUNWAY VACATING (TWY), RWY 03 CLEARED TO LAND`.

Other than traffic information and/or ATC direction to vacate, there will be no indication to the pilot whether the 2,400M runway standard is in use. ATC will advise if a roll-through is available, pilots should not request it unless operationally required. If the aircraft is not directed to roll-through, aircraft should expect to vacate the runway via the exit taxiways specified in Aerodrome DAP Airport Efficiency Procedures to ensure minimum runway occupancy time and support optimum spacing on final.

## Wake Turbulance

### Distance-based Wake Turbulence

| Lead Aircraft | Following Aircraft | Distance (NM) |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Super (A380) | Super | - | 
|  | Heavy | 6 |
|  | Medium | 7 |
|  | Light | 8 |
| Heavy | Heavy | 4 |
|  | Medium | 5 |
|  | Light | 6 |
| Medium | Heavy | - |
|  | Medium | - |
|  | Light | 5 |

### Time-based Wake Turbulence

| Lead Aircraft | Following Aircraft | Time (min) |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Super (A380) | Super | - | 
|  | Heavy | 2 |
|  | Medium | 3 |
|  | Light | 3 |
| Heavy | Heavy | - |
|  | Medium | 2 |
|  | Light | 2 |
| Medium | Heavy | - |
|  | Medium | - |
|  | Light | 2 |


## Procedural
### Lateral Separation
Procedurally, lateral separation can be simplified as below:

*Tracks that intersect at a common point at an angle of less than* ***16°***, *are* ***not laterally separated***  

*Tracks that intersect at a common point at an angle of* ***16°*** *or more, are laterally separated at a distance of* ***15nm or greater*** *from the common point*

Aircraft can be considered laterally separated, if *any* of the two aircraft are greater than 15nm from from the common point, and the tracks intersect at 16° or more.

This can be used to plan restrictions as required if surveillance coverage cannot be assured.
