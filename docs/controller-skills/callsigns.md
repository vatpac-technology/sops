--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

This page lists some of the most commonly used callsigns in Australia.

!!! tip
    For any callsign not listed here or not immediately obvious, after confirming with the pilot or looking it up on google, place *"RTF/CALLSIGN (Callsign)"* in the Remarks section of the aircraft's flight plan, so that other controllers can be aware in advance.  
    Eg: **NWK1601:** *"RTF/CALLSIGN NETLINK"*  
    The pilot may have even filled this out in advance, so be sure to check the Remarks first.
