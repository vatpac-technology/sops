title: Aircraft Callsigns

## Group Form
When using flight number callsigns in Australia, controllers and pilots generally use 'group form'. Group Form is a way of reading out numbers that keeps transmissions clear, efficient, and easy to understand—especially in busy airspace.

Group form means pronouncing the digits in pairs (or "groups") instead of saying each digit separately. This method is used with airline callsigns, military aircraft, and other identifiers that include a rootword followed by numbers.

!!! phraseology
    QLK1148 *"QLink Eleven Forty Eight"*

    VOZ023 - *Velocity Zero Twenty Three*
	
	ASY701 - *Aussie Seven Zero One*
	
	JST900 - *Jetstar Nine Hundred*
	
## Airlines
Unlike in the real world — where only a select number of airlines operate services to Australia — controllers may encounter almost any airline or callsign, including long-defunct or fictional airlines.

Many pilots flying obscure callsigns will notate their callsign in their flight plan remarks (for example, *"RTF/CALLSIGN (callsign)"* ). For any callsign that immediately obvious, controllers should check the remarks for guidance and, if neccessary, put the callsign in the remarks to assist future controllers.

## Common Callsigns in Australia
