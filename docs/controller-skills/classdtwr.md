## Airspace
Remember that in [Class D Airspace](../../controller-skills/airspaceclass), IFR aircraft are separated from IFR and SVFR, and SVFR is separated from SVFR when not VMC. **No separation** is provided for VFR aircraft, even though it is controlled airspace. The Tower Controller provides more of a *"Segregation"* service (ie, providing reasonable opportunity for the aircraft to separate themselves), as well as providing traffic information.

## Visual Separation
For Simulation purposes, Visual Separation is assumed to exist below the Cloud base, and up to 5nm from the ARP. This can be used in conjunction with Surveillance, if available.

## Procedural Separation
At [Tamworth](../../aerodromes/tamworth/), [Coffs Harbour](../../aerodromes/Coffs/), [Hamilton Island](../../aerodromes/Hammo/), and [Sunshine Coast](../../aerodromes/sunshinecoast/) Towers, surveillance coverage cannot be guaranteed at all levels. Therefore, Procedural Standards must be implemented prior to losing surveillance identification of an aircraft, if visual separation cannot be assured below the height at which surveillance coverage will be lost. For more information, refer to Local Instructions.

### Standards
The most relevant Procedural Standards for Class D Towers include:

- [5 min Departures](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#5-min)  
- [10 min Departures](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#10-min)  
- [10nm Arrivals](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#10nm)  
- [5nm Definite Passing](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#5nm-definite-passing)  
- [Sight and Pass](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#sight-and-pass)  
- [Opposite sides of visual fix](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#opposite-sides-of-visual-fix)  
- [Lateral - Conflict Area](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#conflict-area)  
- [Lateral - Lat Sep Table](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#lat-sep-table)  
- [Vertical](../../controller-skills/SepStandards/#vertical)  
- [Tamworth Local Lateral Separation Points](../../aerodromes/tamworth/#local-lateral-separation-points)  

### Control Techniques
When conducting procedural control, it's very important to keep track of instructions, restrictions, reporting points, etc that have been passed, or are going to be passed. When you don't know exactly where the plane is, it can be easy to lose track of if the pilot is complying with what they have been instructed to do. Some tips include:

- Plan restrictions and actions well in advance. ENR must coordinate the sequence to you prior to **5 mins**, that is to give you enough time to plan all the necessary separation
- Using text-on-screen to note Visual fixes, DME/GNSS distances, or passing levels, that pilots have been asked to report at  
- Using label data, local ops and global ops to note restrictions  
- "Sanity checking" any reports that are made
