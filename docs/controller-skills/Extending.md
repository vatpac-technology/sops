As per `VATPAC Controller Position and Ratings Policy`, Enroute controllers are permitted to *extend* to any adjacent sector (with the exception of ML-ASP_CTR, which can only extend to adjacent YMMM sectors).

## Frequency Management
When providing extended coverage, controllers will have multiple frequencies active and at this time, those active frequencies are not displayed to pilots. It can also be confusing as to which frequency a pilot is currently transmitting on.

Here are tips to help manage multiple frequencies:

- Advise the aircraft to transfer frequencies at specific times/situations, such as
    - "at time xx, contact me xxx.xx"
    - "at waypoint ABABI, contact me xxx.xx"
- Include which frequency the aircraft is currently on by placing the First and Last of the 3 letter sector name in the aircraft label.
    - An aircraft on the ML-TBD_CTR frequency would have `TD` in the label.
    - An aircraft on the BN-ARL_CTR frequency would have `AL` in the label.
