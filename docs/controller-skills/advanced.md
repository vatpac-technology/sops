# Separation Assurance

Colloquially, separation assurance could be described as: if you turn away from the screen for 5 minutes, no standard could possibly be infringed. Officially, `MATS 10.1.1.1.1` defines Separation assurance as:  

*(Assuring) separation through the process of assessing traffic, identifying conflicts, planning to ensure separation, executing the plan and monitoring the situation to ensure the standard is not infringed*.  

Here are some techniques to help aid with each of those elements.

### Assessing traffic and Identifying conflicts

There are 3 different ways aircraft could be in conflict;

**Laterally** - Tracks intersecting at more than 45Â°, but less than 135Â°, and the aircraft come within 5nm of each other.  
**Longitudinally** - Tracks intersecting at less than 45Â°, either as a faster following, or opposite direction scenario.  
**Vertically** - Aircraft assigned the same level, or assigned climb/descend through the other aircraft's level(s).  

### Planning to ensure separation
This is where you decide the method for separation assurance. Are you going to implement a restriction to reach a certain altitude by a certain point? Are you going to place a BRL between the aircraft to monitor closing speed? Are you going to anchor a BRL at the point where lateral conflict is infringed, to monitor the aircraft vertically clear? Are you going to give one aircraft a vector to keep clear? There are several different ways to approach resolving these conflicts, so choose the one that best suits the situation, and that you are comfortable with.

### Execute the plan and Monitor the situation

Executing the plan may involve passing instructions to pilots, coordinating with other controllers, and using system tools (eg BRL, Closest Approach), as neccessary. Monitoring the situation is all about using the system tools to your advantage, some examples include:

1) After passing a speed restriction to an aircraft to slow down, watching to make sure the GS has reduced.  
2) Anchoring a BRL between 2 aircraft to see if the distance between is opening or closing.  
3) Using a BRL and velocity vectors to measure distances between conflicts in 1 min, 2 mins, 3 mins, so on.

The BRL Tool has many uses, and is critical to the act of separation assurance.

# Sequencing

It's all well and good maintaining separation standards in your airspace, but if you handoff 2 aircraft to ML_APP overhead LIZZI at the same speed, 1000ft apart, you're not going to make any friends. By default, aircraft must be sequenced **2 minutes** apart at the **Feeder Fix** (ie, the first waypoint of the STAR).  

It's important to remember that aircraft aren't just arriving from your sector, they can be coming in from all directions at similar times. **Maestro** is a tool used to help aid with Sequencing, and you can find more info at https://maestro.vatpac.org/about (link)

There are 3 ways to control the sequence:

### Speed Control
Speed Control is simply slowing aircraft down and speeding aircraft up as required. As a general rule of thumb, Speed Control is most useful to achieve anywhere between a 1 minute expedition, to a 2 minute delay. Some handy indicators to put in the aircraft's label whilst doing speed control are:  
**.78** - Aircraft report - Mach .78  
**M78** - Controller instruction - Maintain Mach .78  
**M78G** - Controller instruction - Maintain Mach .78 or Greater  
**M78L** - Controller instruction - Maintain Mach .78 or Less  
**S260** - Aircraft report - 260kts Indicated  
**260** - Controller instruction - Maintain 260kts Indicated  
**260G** - Controller instruction - Maintain 260kts Indicated or Greater  
**260L** - Controller instruction - Maintain 260kts Indicated or Less  
**MIN** - Controller instruction - Reduce to Minimum Speed  
**MX** - Controller instruction - Increase to Maximum Speed  

### Vectoring
Vectoring aircraft is best to achieve anywhere between a 2 minute and a 6 minute delay. Vectoring aircraft for sequencing involves pointing aircraft away from their route (somewhere between 30Â° and 60Â°) for as long as necessary to achieve the delay. Whilst vectoring, you can anchor a BRL between the aircraft and the Feeder Fix to monitor how much time needs to be lost, then turn the aircraft back on route once the required delay has been achieved.

### Holding
Holding is the final delaying action, useful for when a delay of 6 minutes or more is required. Published Holds exist on common useful holding fixes all around Australia, usually either at the Feeder Fix, or a waypoint before the Feeder Fix. Published Holds can be seen on ERC Charts.

!!! example
    **YWE:** "BNZ135, Showing an 8 minute delay at ARBEY. Fly published hold at APPLE, when ready, descend to reach F250 by APPLE."  
    **BNZ135:** "Fly Published hold at APPLE, when ready, descend to reach F250 by APPLE, BNZ135"  
    ...  
    **YWE:** "BNZ135, Cancel hold, cleared APPLE, ARBEY, to rejoin the STAR, when ready, descend via STAR to A090, QNH 1013"  
    **BNZ135:** "Cancel hold, cleared APPLE, ARBEY, to rejoin the STAR, when ready, descend via STAR to A090, QNH 1013, BNZ135" 

Keep in mind, that not all pilots may be familiar with published holds, and you may need to hold at a non-published point. Utilise the full hold phraseology in this instance.

!!! example
    **ELW:** "VOZ888, Showing a 7 minute delay at LIZZI. Hold at NABBA, Left turns, 2 minute legs, 224 inbound track. When ready, descend to reach F250 by NABBA."  
    **VOZ888:** "Hold at NABBA, Left turns, 2 minute legs, 224 inbound track. When ready, descend to reach F250 by NABBA, VOZ888"  
    ...  
    **ELW:** "VOZ888, Cancel hold, cleared NABBA, BULLA, TAREX, LIZZI, to rejoin the STAR, when ready, maintain F250"  
    **VOZ888:** "Cancel hold, cleared NABBA, BULLA, TAREX, LIZZI, to rejoin the STAR, when ready, maintain F250, VOZ888" 

# Level Check

Unless a level has been "locked in" for an aircraft entering your airspace, either from being inside a change parameter, receiving heads-up coordination, or being a standard assignable level, their CFL cannot be used for separation purposes. Certain aircraft may require additional time to plan restrictions, identify conflicts, etc (For example, as **ELW**, an aircraft cutting across the YMML departure/arrival path at F230), and this is where a **level check** may be useful. If you want to "lock in" a level for an aircraft coming from an adjacent sector, use the following phraseology:

!!! example
    **ELW** -> **YWE**: "Level Check, VOZ456, F360"  
    **YWE** -> **ELW**: "VOZ456, F360"  

Any changes to VOZ456's level would now need to be coordinated by YWE, so no surprises!

Level checks are also useful for when you have identified a conflict, and you need to assign a different level to the one currently assigned by the controlling sector in order to assure separation.

!!! example
    **BIK** -> **SDS**: "Level Check, JST123, Assigned F200 due crossing traffic"  
    **SDS** -> **BIK**: "JST123, F200"  

When using the level check technique, bear in mind the sector that you're coordinating with may have no idea what a Level Check is. Use plain english as required to get the message across (and be nice ðŸ˜Š).
