Australia covers 11% of the world's airspace. As such, controllers (espeacially those providing extended coverage services) can find them selves providing ATS over a wide geographical area. Controllers covering major airports like Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane can also commonly find themselves in a high-density traffic situation.

Below we discuss some techniques controllers can use to manage and reduce their workload, allowing them to provide a better service and stay 'ahead of the game'.

## Frequency Management
When providing extended coverage, controllers will have multiple frequencies active and at this time, those active frequencies are not displayed to pilots. It can also be confusing as to which frequency a pilot is currently transmitting on.

Here are tips to help manage multiple frequencies:

- Advise the aircraft to transfer frequencies at specific times/situations, such as
    - "at time xx, contact me xxx.xx"
    - "at top of descent, contact me xxx.xx"
    - "at waypoint ABABI, contact me xxx.xx"
- Include wehich frequency the aircraft is currently on by plaxing the First and Last of the 3 letter sector name in the aircraft label.
    - An aircraft on the ML-TBD_CTR frequency would have `TD` in the label.
    - An aircraft on the BN-ARL_CTR frequency would have `AL` in the label.

!!! Example
    You have an aircraft that is climbing to cruise altitude from Hobart/Launceston to Melbourne.
    Advise the aircraft "At top of descent, contact me 123.75".

## Altitude Management
When issuing a climb or descent instruction, as yourself, what altitude/level can assign which results in the smallest number of transmissions.

A common habit is to see controllers clearing aircraft "when ready" to FL250 on descent, despite there being no reason to do so. If there is no traffic restrictions and CTA LL permits, descent the aircraft to the CTA LL.

!!! Example
    VOZ888 is tracking from Sydney to Melbourne via the Q29 airway to LIZZI for the LIZZI8A arrival runway 34.

    "VOZ888, when ready, descend via the STAR 9000 FT, QNH 1009."

Use "descend via STAR" phraseology when CTA protection is in place, through the use of height requirements on the STAR.

!!! Example
    RXA4652 is tracking via ODALE for the ODALE7 STAR to runway 34R. CTA LL is 8000FT, but the STAR has built-in CTA protection (8000FT ABOVE at KABLO)

    "RXZ4652, Sydney Approach, runway 34R, descend via the STAR to 6000FT"
