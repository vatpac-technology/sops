title: Coordination

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

Coordination requirements are often very location-specific, however this page outlines the general guidelines to coordination, which are supplemented by Local Instructions.

## Types of Coordination
### Heads-up

Heads-up Coordination is the act of giving the next sector a "heads-up" about an aircraft about to enter their airspace. The format is as follows:

Controlling Sector -> Receiving Sector: "(Position), (Callsign)"  
Receiving Sector -> Controlling Sector: "(Callsign), (Level)"

!!! example
    ELW -> BIK: "via CB, VOZ1234"  
    BIK -> ELW: "VOZ1234, F350"  

If the level that will be assigned at transfer of jurisdiction is different from the current CFL, the Controlling Sector will use the phrase "Will be assigned (level)".

Once this coordination is completed, the aircraft's level and route is **locked in**. Any further changes must be recoordinated.

!!! example
    ELW -> BIK: "VOZ1234, requesting DCT RIVET"  
    BIK -> ELW: "VOZ1234, concur DCT RIVET"  

### Voiceless

Certain routes, areas, levels, airspace, etc, will have voiceless coordination agreements, which is where Heads-Up Coordination is not required. These routes may also have change parameters, where no changes are permitted within a certain distance of the sector boundary without prior coordination.

### Boundary

Where an aircraft will deviate laterally within 2.5nm, or vertically within 500ft of another sector's airspace, boundary coordination must be completed so they are aware of the aircraft, and can nominate any restrictions. The format is as follows:

Controlling Sector -> Boundary Sector: "For Ident, (Position), (Callsign), (Details as required)"  
Boundary Sector -> Controlling Sector: "(Callsign), (Restriction)"

!!! example
    BIK -> CAE: "For Ident, overhead CB, QFA12, do you have any restrictions on descent?"  
    CAE -> BIK: "QFA12, No restrictions on descent"  

The Boundary Sector may omit the restriction and readback the callsign only. This will be taken as the Boundary Sector having **no vertical or lateral restrictions**.

!!! example
    INL -> BAS: "For Ident, West of BLAKA, ABC"  
    BAS -> INL: "ABC"

## Rules

### ENR/TCU -> Class D TWR
Voice coordinate Sequence prior to transfer
### Class D TWR -> ENR/TCU
Voice coordinate Taxi call for CTA departures, Next call for **all** departures
### ENR -> TCU
Voiceless for aircraft landing at main airport (eg YMML in ML TCU), assigned a STAR, and standard assignable level.  
Voice coordinate all other aircraft by 20nm
### TCU -> ENR
Voiceless for aircraft assigned lower of standard assignable level or RFL
### ENR -> Oceanic
Voice coordinate estimate and level prior to 15 mins
### Oceanic -> ENR
Voice coordinate estimate and level prior to 15 mins
### ENR -> ENR
Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within 50nm
### Handoffs
Receiving a handoff means you are permitted to turn an aircraft 45 degrees left or right, and climb/descend it to any level without coordination. Do not handoff an aircraft to another sector if a turn of 45 degrees or a change of level would cause a conflict with any of your own aircraft. Or alternatively, you can nominate a restriction prior to handoff.

!!! example
    YWE -> TBD: "ABC, my restriction is DEF, calls you now"  
    TBD -> YWE: "ABC, restriction is DEF, calls me now"
