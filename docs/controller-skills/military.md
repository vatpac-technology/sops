## Restricted Areas
Australian airspace is covered in Restricted Areas. Put simply, these are areas where aircraft are not allowed to go. They are shown in vatSys in yellow as below:

### Vertical Limits
The Restricted Areas cover various altitudes, and these can be seen either in the Restricted Areas window in vatSys, the [ERSA](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp){target=new}, or by referencing VTC, VNC, ERC and TAC charts.

### Separation
It is the pilots responsibility to remain clear of Restricted Areas, however, that does not mean they always do!

#### OCTA
Outside controlled airspace, it is the responsibility of the controller to provide Safety Alerts on aircraft that will shortly enter, or have already entered, active restricted areas.

!!! example
    **CBW**: "Safety Alert, VFR aircraft overhead Cotter tracking southbound 2500, you will shortly be entering R430 restricted area, clearance not available, suggest immediate left turn to avoid"

!!! example
    **CNK**: "VFR aircraft overhead YCNK 3500 tracking westbound, confirm you will be remaining clear of the R564 restricted area?"  
    To which they will almost always reply with either *"Affirm"* or *"Huh?"*

For aircraft unfamiliar with the restricted area, provide *suggested* headings to avoid. Get the aircraft to squawk ident to temporarily identify them. Remember that you cannot vector aircraft OCTA.

#### CTA
You must separate all aircraft in controlled airspace by *half the applicable lateral standard* from a Restricted Area (ie, **1.5nm** for TCU, **2.5nm** for Enroute). Aircraft operating at the vertical limits of Restricted Areas are considered to be separated from it.

### Activation times
Some Restricted Areas are not always active. Some may be active only on certain days, or certain hours of the day. More info can be found in the [ERSA](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp){target=new}, or on the Restricted Areas window in vatSys

#### NOTAM
Some Restricted Areas will be activated by NOTAM, most commonly for use by RAAF Virtual. These are available on the [VATPAC NOTAMs Page](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new}. These Restricted Areas will automatically become active on vatSys with AIRAC updates, so they are visually displayed on the screen.

#### Aircraft operating inside Restricted Area
Military aircraft are permitted to operate within their designated Restricted Area as per the relevant NOTAM. Even if this Restricted Area is inside your airspace, you have no control authority over it.

!!! example
    **ARA**: "DRGN379, shortly entering R604 Restricted Area, identification and control services terminated, frequency change approved. Contact me prior to leaving for airways clearance"  
    **DRGN379**: "Wilco, DRGN379"

## Initial and Pitch
The Initial and Pitch arrival is a specialized military approach used primarily by fast jets to safely reduce speed and prepare for landing. Unlike standard civilian approaches, the Initial and Pitch involves a series of tight turns, allowing the aircraft to maintain higher speeds until the final stages of the approach.

### Procedure Outline

#### 1.1. The Initial
- **Objective:** To position the aircraft on a long final approach in preparation for the pitch.
- **Typical Altitude:** 1,500 feet AGL for fast jets; 1,000 feet AGL for other aircraft.
- **Typical Speed:** 250 to 350 knots.
- **Entry:** The aircraft (or formation) will track to the Initial Point, a point 5NM downwind of the runway in use, displaced to the dead side, and track inbound at high speeds.

**Phraseology Example:**  
Controller: "Tiger 11, join the Initial runway 18, maintain 1,500 feet, report Initial."

#### 1.2. The Pitch
- **Objective:** To reduce speed rapidly while aligning with the runway for final approach.
- **Execution:** At a point abeam the threshold of the runway in use and when safe to do so, the aircraft will turn ("pitch") to join downwind and configure for landing. Fast jets typically pitch at 1,500 feet AGL, while other aircraft pitch at 1,000 feet AGL. Tactical missions may involve a low Initial and Pitch at altitudes below normal.

**Phraseology Example:**  
Controller: "Tiger 11, cleared to break at Initial. Report base leg."

#### 1.3. The Final Approach
- **Objective:** To stabilize the aircraft for landing after completing the pitch.
- **Typical Altitude:** 1,000 feet AGL or circuit altitude.
- **Speed:** Final approach speed (varies depending on aircraft type).

**Phraseology Example:**  
Controller: "Tiger 11, continue approach, runway 18, wind 170 at 10 knots, cleared to land."

### 2. TCU Controller Responsibilities

#### 2.1. Traffic Coordination
- **Coordination with Adjacent Sectors:** Ensure coordination with adjacent sectors, particularly the Tower, to avoid conflicts with other traffic during the high-speed Initial approach. Note that at controlled aerodromes, military pilots must comply with ATC circuit entry instructions unless approved for an Initial and Pitch entry.
- **Phraseology Example:** "East Sale Tower, East Sale TCU, Tiger 11 joining Initial runway 18, expect break."

#### 2.2. Airspace Management
- **Handling Multiple Aircraft:** When multiple aircraft are conducting Initial and Pitch procedures, instruct each aircraft to maintain separation and provide sequencing to ensure safe operation.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 12, maintain 1,500 feet, follow Tiger 11, report Initial."

#### 2.3. Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Adjusting for Traffic:** If traffic or weather conditions necessitate, the controller may instruct the pilot to extend the downwind leg or adjust altitude.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 11, extend downwind, traffic in sight."

#### 2.4. Communication
- **Clear and Concise Instructions:** Given the high-speed nature of these operations, clear and concise communication is essential. Pilots conducting this maneuver will typically broadcast their position at the Initial Point and on the base turn.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 11, pitch approved, maintain visual with traffic, report final."

### 3. ADC (Aerodrome Controller) Perspective

#### 3.1. Circuit Entry Management
- **Monitoring Circuit Entry:** ADCs must ensure that aircraft joining the circuit via the Initial and Pitch procedure do so without conflicting with other circuit traffic. Clear instructions should be given to integrate the military traffic seamlessly into the circuit pattern.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 11, report downwind, maintain visual separation from circuit traffic."

#### 3.2. Sequence Management
- **Sequencing Aircraft:** When handling multiple aircraft performing Initial and Pitch entries, ensure proper sequencing to avoid conflicts. ADCs should communicate with the TCU to maintain situational awareness.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 12, number two, follow Tiger 11, report base."

#### 3.3. Coordination with TCU
- **Coordination:** Continuous coordination with the TCU is vital to manage inbound military traffic and ensure that all circuit operations, including departures, are conducted safely.
- **Phraseology Example:** "East Sale TCU, East Sale Tower, confirm Tiger 11 cleared to pitch, runway 18."

#### 3.4. Handling Low Pitch Procedures
- **Low Pitch Awareness:** Be aware of aircraft conducting low Initial and Pitch procedures, which may require special handling due to their lower altitude and higher speed.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 11, cleared for low pitch, maintain 1,000 feet, report base."

### 4. Common Scenarios and Contingencies

#### 4.1. Go-Around Procedure
- **If a go-around is required:** Instruct the pilot to break off the approach and rejoin the Initial or enter the standard circuit.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 11, go around, rejoin Initial runway 18."

#### 4.2. Deconfliction
- **Handling Conflicting Traffic:** If another aircraft is on final or conflicting with the Initial, provide vectoring instructions to deconflict.
- **Phraseology Example:** "Tiger 11, break left immediately, traffic at your 2 o'clock."

### 5. Key Points to Remember
- **High-Speed Nature:** Military fast jets will approach at speeds significantly higher than civilian traffic. Be prepared for rapid decision-making and adjustments.
- **Visual Monitoring:** Maintain visual monitoring of traffic patterns to anticipate potential conflicts.
- **Effective Coordination:** Close coordination with Tower and other relevant sectors is crucial to managing traffic effectively during these operations.
