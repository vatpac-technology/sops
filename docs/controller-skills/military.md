## Special Use Airspace (SUA)
SUAs, formerly known as Restricted Areas (RAs), are scattered all over Australian airspace. In real life, they can be used for many different purposes, including, but not limited to:

- Military Activity (Most common)
- Live Firing
- Airshows
- Operationally Restricted Airspace
- Radiation Hazards
- Rocket Launches

Although the majority of these things don't pose any hazards in the online environment, activations of SUAs should still be simulated on VATSIM, and aircraft should be kept clear of them.

### Vertical Limits
The Restricted Areas cover various altitudes, and these can be seen either in the Restricted Areas window in vatSys, the [ERSA](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp){target=new}, or by referencing VTC, VNC, ERC and TAC charts.

### Separation
It is the pilots responsibility to remain clear of Restricted Areas, however, that does not mean they always do!

#### OCTA
Outside controlled airspace, it is the responsibility of the controller to provide Safety Alerts on aircraft that will shortly enter, or have already entered, active restricted areas.

!!! example
    **CBW**: "Safety Alert, VFR aircraft overhead Cotter tracking southbound 2500, you will shortly be entering R430 restricted area, clearance not available, suggest immediate left turn to avoid"

!!! example
    **CNK**: "VFR aircraft overhead YCNK 3500 tracking westbound, confirm you will be remaining clear of the R564 restricted area?"  
    To which they will almost always reply with either *"Affirm"* or *"Huh?"*

For aircraft unfamiliar with the restricted area, provide *suggested* headings to avoid. Get the aircraft to squawk ident to temporarily identify them. Remember that you cannot vector aircraft OCTA.

#### CTA
You must separate all aircraft in controlled airspace by *half the applicable lateral standard* from a Restricted Area (ie, **1.5nm** for TCU, **2.5nm** for Enroute). Aircraft operating at the vertical limits of Restricted Areas are considered to be separated from it.

### Activation times
Some Restricted Areas are not always active. Some may be active only on certain days, or certain hours of the day. More info can be found in the [ERSA](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp){target=new}, or on the Restricted Areas window in vatSys

### NOTAM
Some Restricted Areas will be activated by NOTAM, most commonly for use by RAAF Virtual. These are available on the [VATPAC NOTAMs Page](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new}. These Restricted Areas will automatically become active on vatSys with AIRAC updates, so they are visually displayed on the screen.

### Aircraft operating inside Restricted Area
Military aircraft are permitted to operate within their designated Restricted Area as per the relevant NOTAM. Even if this Restricted Area is inside your airspace, you have no control authority over it.

!!! example
    **ARA**: "DRGN379, shortly entering R604 Restricted Area, identification and control services terminated, frequency change approved. Contact me prior to leaving for airways clearance"  
    **DRGN379**: "Wilco, DRGN379"

### ATC Activated Military Airspace
Most Military TCUs and Tower positions, when online, control airspace that correspond to certain Restricted Area Activations. These are prescribed in the Local Instructions.

These Restricted Areas may be activated in vatSys, and the controllers of these positions may inform other surrounding controllers of their activations, so they may use the Resitricted Areas on the screen to visually assess the airspace and separation required for traffic.

Unless otherwise stated in Local Instructions, Restricted Areas activated for control by Military TCUs and Towers, will become **Class C** airspace.
