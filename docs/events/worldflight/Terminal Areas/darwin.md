## Runway 29 Departures

## Flow
### Speeds
TRT will instruct all arrivals to cross **ANUPA** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

## WorldFlight Teams
[WorldFlight Teams](../../../../#official-team-callsigns) will be highlighted by default and should receive priority at all stages of flight.
