## Airspace Division
Standard airspace division will be in use as per [DN TCU Local Instructions](../../../../../../terminal/darwin/#airspace-division).

However, **DAE** will handle all departures **regardless of duty runway**. DAW has *No Restrictions or Requirements* on Runway 29 Departures.

**DAW** will handle all arrivals from the **south and west**. DAE has *No Restrictions or Requirements* on arrivals via the **ANUPA** or **WANGI** STARs. DAW shall clear these aircraft for the approach and transfer them to ADC.

DAW and DAW have a **shared responsibility** to maintain separation of aircraft along the final approach path.

## Runway 29 Departures
Departures from Runway 29 will call DAE on an assigned heading of **H360** assigned `A050`. These aircraft will pass *underneath* aircraft inbound on the ANUPA STAR and can be cleared DCT **TOREX** and climbed when suitable.

## Runway 29 Arrivals
Arrivals to Runway 29 on the **ANUPA** STAR shall be initially cleared to descend via STAR to `A060`. Once east of the event departure track, they may be descended further in preparation for the approach.

## Flow
### Speeds
TRT will instruct all arrivals to cross **ANUPA** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

## Coordination
### DN ADC
#### Auto Release
Available for aircraft assigned `A050`, and:

| Runway | SID | Assigned Heading |
| ---------- | --- | --- |
| 11 | DN7 | H030 |
| 29 | DN7 | H360 |

### DN TCU Internal
Arrivals/Departures on **Runway 29** will transit both DAW and DAE airspace.

DAW has *No Restrictions or Requirements* on Runway 29 Departures.  
DAE has *No Restrictions or Requirements* on Runway 29 Arrivals from the west or south.

### DAE to TRS
An airspace release from TRT will allow TRS to take ownership of all airspace from the southeastern boundary, north to the outbound leg route. All event aircraft shall be handed to TRS, **not TRT**.

Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **TOREX**

All other aircraft going to TRS CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### TRT to DAW
Standard as per [DN TCU Local Instructions](../../../../../../terminal/darwin/#arrivals)
