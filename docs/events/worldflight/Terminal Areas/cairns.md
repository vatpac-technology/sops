## Airspace Division
Standard airspace division will be in use as per [CS TCU Local Instructions](../../../../../../terminal/cairns/#airspace-division).

**CS1** will handle all departures **regardless of duty runway**.

**CS2** will handle all arrivals from the **south and west**. CS1 has *No Restrictions or Requirements* for aircraft cleared via the **CODIE STAR** to Runway 15.

## Runway 33 Departures
Departures from Runway 33 will call **CS1** on an assigned heading of **H040** assigned `A060`. These aircraft should be climbed above the MVA/MSA and then cleared direct to **AKROM** when suitable.

## Runway 15 Arrivals
Event aircraft will be cleared the **CODIE1A** STAR, **OVLET** transition. They should be cleared for the ILS approach and transfered to ADC by CS2.

## Runway 33 Arrivals
Event aircraft will be cleared the **HENDO2A** STAR, **OVLET** transition. They will be processed via the LOC approach.

## Flow
### Speeds
KEN will instruct all arrivals to cross **OVLET** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

## WorldFlight Teams
