---

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Sector Responsibilities
### Arafura (ARA)
ARA will be responsible for starting to form the sequence in to YBCS, by applying *speed control* in the cruise.

### Baria (BAR)
BAR will be responsible for issuing STAR clearances in to YBCS, and finalising the sequence using *speed control* and *vectors* in to YBCS.

#### STARs
See [STAR Clearances](#star-clearances)

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **OVLET** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to CS TCU is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed).

## STAR Clearances
All aircraft shall be issued a STAR in accordance with the table below:

| Duty Runway | STAR |
| ---------- | --- |
| RWY 15 | CODIE1A, OVLET transition |
| RWY 33 | HENDO2A, OVLET transition |

## WorldFlight Teams
[WorldFlight Teams](../../../../#official-team-callsigns) will be highlighted by default and should receive priority at all stages of flight.

## Coordination
### WAAF CTR to ARA
As per [standard ISA coordination procedures](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/ISA/#international-waaf), all aircraft should be **Heads-up Coordinated** by WAAF CTR prior to **30 mins** from boundary.

!!! tip
    It may be prudent (especially if they are using vatSys) to set up a Voiceless Coordination Agreement with WAAF CTR, in order to reduce workload for both controllers.

### ARA to BAR
Standard as per [KEN Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/KEN).

### BAR to CS TCU
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned `A070`; and
- Assigned a STAR

All other aircraft coming from BAR CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to CS TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

!!! note
    All arriving aircraft from the north and west will be handled by CS2, regardless of duty runway.

### CS TCU to KEN
Standard as per [KEN Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/KEN).

!!! note
    All departing aircraft will be handled by CS1, regardless of duty runway.
