--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Sector Responsibilities
### Gold Coast (GOL)
GOL is responsible for reclearing certain aircraft via **RIKNI MARLN**.

**All** aircraft that GOL receives from BDS/BDN on a heading *east* of **SANEG** shall be recleared via this amended tracking.

Additionally, GOL may reclear more aircraft from the standard route to the amended **RIKNI MARLN** tracking, in order to keep a 50/50 balance between **BOREE** and **MARLN** arrivals in to **YSSY**.  

**Do not** reclear **Heavy** or **Super** aircraft via **MEPIL**. Leave them on planned route.

### Inverell (INL)
INL will be responsible for starting to form the sequence in to YSSY, by applying *speed control* in the cruise.

INL will be responsible for the INL subsector **only**.

### Armidale (ARL)
ARL will be responsible for issuing STAR clearances in to YSSY for aircraft tracking via **BOREE** and **MEPIL** only, and finalising the sequence using *speed control* and *vectors* in to YSSY.

ARL will be responsible for the ARL and MNN subsectors **only**.

!!! tip
    Early Handoffs to CNK (~30-50nm from boundary) are a great way to balance workload.

#### STARs

| Fix | Runway | STAR |
| ---------- | --- | --- |
| BOREE      | 16R | BOREE4P |
| BOREE      | 34L | BOREE4A |
| MEPIL      | **16R** | MEPIL3 |
| MEPIL      | **34L** | MEPIL3 |

### Cessnock (CNK)
CNK will be responsible for finessing the sequence in to YSSY if required.

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **BOREE** or **YAKKA** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to SAN/SAS is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

### Ocean (OCN)
ARL will be responsible for issuing STAR clearances in to YSSY for aircraft tracking via **MARLN** only, and finalising the sequence using *speed control* and *vectors* in to YSSY.

OCN will be responsible for the OCN subsector **only**.

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **MARLN** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to SAN/SAS is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

!!! tip
    Track shortening direct to MARLN may help to close any gaps ahead of aircraft. [Coordination](#between-arlcnk-and-sfl) is required.

## Official WorldFlight Teams
Most official team aircraft will depart from YBCG and track via **WLM** to facilitate their scenic arrival into YSSY. These aircraft should not be issued a STAR clearance. Assign these aircraft `A090` and pass them to SAN/SAS.

!!! warning "Important"
    The YBCG to WLM track approximates a northbound airway. Be vigilant for any aircraft departing YSSY to the north who may conflict with the southbound aircraft.

## Coordination
### BDN/BDS to GOL
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **SANEG**; or  
- East of **SANEG**, Assigned a Heading between **H180**-**H160**.

All other aircraft going to GOL CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### ARL to CNK
Changes to Route and CFL are **permitted** within **50nm** of the boundary, without coordination, for sequencing purposes.  
Aircraft must be tracking via **BOREE** or **MEPIL**.

### CNK/OCN to SAS/SAN
Standard as per [ARL Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/ARL/#arrivalsoverfliers).

**BOREE**/**MEPIL** Arrivals will be handed off to SAN.  
**MARLN** Arrivals will be handed off to SAS.  

#### Between ARL/CNK and SFL
SFL will construct the sequence via the [Arrivals List Window](../../../../../../controller-skills/sequencing/#arrivals-list).

Appropriate annotations for the Arrivals List Window can be found [here](../../../../../../client/annotations/#sequencingflow).

SFL must **voice coordinate** any changes to instructions after ARL/CNK/OCN has put a `<` on it.

SFL will **voice coordinate** to ARL any aircraft that must be rerouted via **RIKNI MARLN** for **16L/34R**.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**SFL** -> **ARL**</span>: "ANZ361 via MARLN for 34R please"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **SFL**</span>: "ANZ361 via MARLN for 34R, will be"  

ARL/CNK/OCN must **voice coordinate** any requests for *Track Shortening* or *CSR* to SFL.

!!! tip
    If in your judgement, the request won't be available due to the sequence, there is no need to voice coordinate the requests. Just deny them.
