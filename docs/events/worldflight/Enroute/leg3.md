## Sector Responsibilities
### Arafura (ARA)
ARA will be responsible for the ARA subsector **only**. The North-east portion of TRT airspace is [released](#trt-release) to ARA.

ARA shall ensure adequate vertical separation exists between nearby aircraft and may establish basic speed control to avoid any overtaking occurring.

## WorldFlight Teams
[WorldFlight Teams](../../../../#official-team-callsigns) will be highlighted by default and should receive priority at all stages of flight.

### ARA to WAAF CTR
As per [standard ISA coordination procedures](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/ISA/#international-waaf), all aircraft should be **Heads-up Coordinated** to WAAF CTR prior to **30 mins** from boundary.

!!! tip
    It may be prudent (especially if they are using vatSys) to set up a Voiceless Coordination Agreement with WAAF CTR, in order to reduce workload for both controllers.
