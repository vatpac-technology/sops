## Sector Responsibilities
### Territory (TRS)
TRS will be responsible for the TRS subsector **only**. The TRT airspace from the southeastern boundary north to the outbound leg route is released from TRT to TRS.

TRS shall ensure adequate vertical separation exists between nearby aircraft and may establish basic speed control to avoid any overtaking occurring.

## WorldFlight Teams
[WorldFlight Teams](../../../../#official-team-callsigns) will be highlighted by default and should receive priority at all stages of flight.

## Coordination
### DAE to TRS
Standard as per [TRT Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/TRT).

!!! note
    All departing aircraft will be handled by DAE, regardless of duty runway.

### TRS to WAAF CTR
As per [standard TRT coordination procedures](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/TRT/#international-waaf), all aircraft should be **Heads-up Coordinated** to WAAF CTR prior to **30 mins** from boundary.

!!! tip
    It may be prudent (especially if they are using vatSys) to set up a Voiceless Coordination Agreement with WAAF CTR, in order to reduce workload for both controllers.
