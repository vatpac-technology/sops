--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Sector Responsibilities
### Gold Coast (GOL)
GOL is responsible for reclearing certain aircraft via **OLTIN YAKKA MEPIL**.

**All** aircraft that GOL receives from BDS/BDN on a heading *east* of **SANEG** shall be recleared via this amended tracking.

Additionally, GOL may reclear more aircraft from the standard route to the amended **OLTIN YAKKA MEPIL** tracking, in order to keep a 50/50 balance between **BOREE** and **MEPIL** arrivals in to **YSSY**.  
**Do not** reclear **Heavy** or **Super** aircraft via **MEPIL**. Leave them on planned route.

### Inverell (INL)
INL will be responsible for starting to form the sequence in to YSSY, by applying *speed control* in the cruise.

INL will be responsible for the INL subsector **only**.

### Armidale (ARL)
ARL will be responsible for issuing STAR clearances in to YSSY, and finalising the sequence using *speed control* and *vectors* in to YSSY.

ARL will be responsible for the ARL and MNN subsectors **only**.

!!! tip
    Early Handoffs to CNK (~30-50nm from boundary) are a great way to balance workload

#### STARs

| Fix | Runway | STAR |
| ---------- | --- | --- |
| BOREE      | 16R | BOREE3P |
| BOREE      | 34L | BOREE3A |
| MEPIL      | 16L | MEPIL3 |
| MEPIL      | 34R | MEPIL3 |

### Cessnock (CNK)
CNK will be responsible for finessing the sequence in to YSSY if required.

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **BOREE** or **YAKKA** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to SAN/SAS is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

## Coordination
### BDN/BDS to GOL
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **SANEG**; or  
- East of **SANEG**, Assigned a Heading between **H180**-**H160**.

All other aircraft going to GOL CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### ARL to CNK
Changes to Route and CFL are **permitted** within **50nm** of the boundary, without coordination, for sequencing purposes.  
Aircraft must be tracking via **BOREE** or **MEPIL**.

### CNK to SAS/SAN
Standard as per [ARL Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/ARL/#arrivalsoverfliers).

**BOREE** Arrivals will be handed off to SAS.  
**MEPIL** Arrivals will be handed off to SAN.  

#### Between ARL/CNK and SFL
SFL will construct the sequence via the [Arrivals List Window](../../../../../../controller-skills/sequencing/#arrivals-list).

Appropriate annotations for the Arrivals List Window can be found [here](../../../../../../client/annotations/#sequencingflow).

SFL must **voice coordinate** any changes to instructions after ARL/CNK has put a `<` on it.

SFL will **voice coordinate** to ARL/CNK any aircraft that must be rerouted via **OLTIN YAKKA MEPIL** for **16L/34R**.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**SFL** -> **ARL**</span>: "ANZ361 via OLTIN for 34R please"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **SFL**</span>: "ANZ361 via OLTIN for 34R, will be"  

ARL/CNK must **voice coordinate** any requests for *Track Shortening* or *CSR* to SFL.

!!! tip
    If in your judgement, the request won't be available due to the sequence, there is no need to voice coordinate the requests. Just deny them.
