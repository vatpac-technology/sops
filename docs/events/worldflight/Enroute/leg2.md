## Sector Responsibilities
### Territory (TRT)
TRT is responsible for issuing STAR Clearances and all sequencing actions in to YPDN.

TRT will be responsible for the TRT subsector **only**.

During the subsequent departure leg, TRS shall extend their jurisdiction into TRT to include the departure route to WAJJ.

#### STARs
All aircraft shall be issued the **ANUPA1A** STAR.  

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **ANUPA** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to DAW is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

## Coordination
### WAAF CTR to TRT
As per [standard TRT coordination procedures](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/TRT/#international-waaf), all aircraft should be **Heads-up Coordinated** by WAAF CTR prior to **30 mins** from boundary.

!!! tip
    It may be prudent (especially if they are using vatSys) to set up a Voiceless Coordination Agreement with WAAF CTR, in order to reduce workload for both controllers.

### TRT to DAW
Standard as per [TRT Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Brisbane Centre/TRT/#arrivalsoverfliers).
