## Positions
FOW is an additional non-standard sector for the event (Split from FOR).

| Name | Callsign | Frequency | Login ID |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Forrest West | Melbourne Centre | 131.700 | ML-FOW_CTR |

## Sector Responsibilities
### Tailem Bend (TBD)
TBD has *no Restrictions or Requirements* on YPAD departures tracking DCT **LONLY**.

### Augusta (AUG), Forrest (FOR), Forrest West (FOW)
AUG, FOR, and FOW will be responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight. No sequencing actions are required.

!!! warning "Caution"
    AUG and FOR should look out for aircraft converging at **LONLY** and **LESON** respectively, at the same time and level. Use vertical separation wherever possible.

### Esperance (ESP)
ESP will be responsible for starting to form the sequence in to YPPH, by applying *speed control* in the cruise.

ESP must also check for LAHSO compliance during the [03A06D Runway Mode](#03a06d-lahso).

### Hyden (HYD)
HYD will be responsible for issuing STAR clearances in to YPPH, and finalising the sequence using *speed control* and *vectors* in to YPPH.

HYD may vector in to CRS or JAR airspace if required for sequencing.

#### STARs
All aircraft shall be issued the **KABLI1A** STAR.  

### Pingelly (PIY)
PIY will be responsible for finessing the sequence in to YPPH if required.

PIY will be responsible for the PIY **subsector only**.

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **KABLI** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to PHA is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

## YPPH Arrivals
### Runway Modes
Depending on wind limitations, there are two possible Runway Modes in use at YPAD.

#### 24A21D
During 24A21D, **Heavy** and **Super** aircraft must be asked if they *operationally require* Runway 21 for arrival.

Aircraft that operationally require Runway 21 may be cleared for the KABLI1A/21 without coordination.

#### 03A06D (LAHSO)
During 03A06D, ESP must ask **Heavy** and **Super** aircraft if they are able to Land and Hold Short of Runway 06.

Landing Distance Available (LDA) for Runway 03 LAHSO is **2355m**.

Aircraft that are *unable* to Land and Hold Short of Runway 06 must have `XX` entered in their scratchpad.

## Coordination
### AAW to AUG
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **GILES**; or  
- North of **GILES**, DCT **LESON**; or  
- South of **GILES**, DCT **LONLY**

All other aircraft going to AUG CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### HYD to PIY
Changes to Route and CFL are **permitted** within **50nm** of the boundary, without coordination, for sequencing purposes.  
Aircraft must be tracking via **MALUP** or **KABLI**, with the exception of:  
**Runway 21** Arrivals may be assigned a Heading **North** of the **MALUP-KABLI** track, without coordination.

### PIY to PHA
Standard as per [PIY Local Instructions](../../../../../../enroute/Melbourne Centre/PIY/#arrivalsoverfliers), with the exception of:

- During the [24A21D Runway Mode](#24a21d), arrivals assigned **Runway 21** may be handed off to PHA on a **Heading** *north* of the Runway 24 arrivals, without coordination.

#### Between PIY/HYD and PFL
PFL will construct the sequence via the [Arrivals List Window](../../../../../../controller-skills/sequencing/#arrivals-list).

Appropriate annotations for the Arrivals List Window can be found [here](../../../../../../client/annotations/#sequencingflow).

PFL must **voice coordinate** any changes to instructions after PIY/HYD has put a `<` on it.

PIY/HYD must **voice coordinate** any requests for *Track Shortening*, *CSR*, or *Victor/Xray STARs*, to PFL.

!!! tip
    If in your judgement, the request won't be available due to the sequence, there is no need to voice coordinate the requests. Just deny them.
