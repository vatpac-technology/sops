## Airspace
Remember that in [Class D Airspace](../../controller-skills/classofairspace), IFR aircraft are separated from IFR and SVFR, and SVFR is separated from SVFR when visibility is not VMC. **No separation** is provided for VFR aircraft, even though it is controlled airspace. The Tower Controller provides more of a *"Segregation"* service (ie, providing reasonable opportunity for the aircraft to separate themselves), as well as providing traffic information.

## Surveillance
Although Surveillance standards cannot be used for separation at Class D Towers, overlying TCU/Enroute controllers can use their surveillance standards to help Class D towers achieve separation, when procedural separation is a bit awkward or impractical.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "Can you advise when QLK208D is 5nm clear of DSB?"  
    <span class="hotline">**BLA** -> **AY ADC**</span>: "Affirm, will do"  
    ...  
    <span class="hotline">**BLA** -> **AY ADC**</span>: "QLK208D, 5nm clear of DSB"  
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "QLK208D, 5nm clear of DSB, thanks"

## Lateral
### 45° Segregated Flight Paths
#### Straight-in
- Can be applied between departures and arrivals when the departing aircraft's flight path and the arrival aircraft's flight path are at least 45° clear of each other, and, for a straight-in approach, the arriving aircraft is at least **5nm** from the arrival runway threshold

#### Visual, DME/GNSS, Circle to land
- Can be applied between departures and arrivals when the departing aircraft's flight path and the arrival aircraft's flight path are at least 45° clear of each other, and, for a Visual, DME/GNSS or Circle to land approach, the arriving aircraft is at least **10nm** from the airfield
