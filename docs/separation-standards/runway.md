## Takeoff
### Behind a preceding departing aircraft
- Preceding departing aircraft;  
    - has crossed the up-wind end of the runway-in-use; or  
    - has commenced a turn; or  
    - is airborne and has reached a point at least 1800m (6000ft) ahead of the following aircraft provided the runway is longer than 1800m (6000ft); and  
    - [Wake Turbulence](#wake-turbulence) requirements are met

### Behind a preceding landing aircraft
- Preceding landing aircraft has vacated and is taxiing away from the runway

### Behind landing or departing aircraft on intersecting runways
- Preceding departing aircraft on an intersecting runway has crossed the intersection; or  
- An aircraft landing on the crossing runway has either crossed the intersection or stopped short.

### After aircraft has departed in the opposite direction
- Preceding aircraft has crossed the point at which the following aircraft will commence take-off

## Landing
### Behind a preceding landing aircraft
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold until the preceding aircraft has vacated and is taxiing away from the runway, and  
- [Wake Turbulence](#wake-turbulence) requirements are met

#### 2400m Reduced Runway Separation Minima
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold unless:  
    - the preceding aircraft has landed and has passed a point at least 2400m from the threshold of the runway; and  
    - the preceding aircraft is in motion and will vacate the runway without backtracking, and  
    - the preceding aircraft has an MTOW of 7000kg or more; and  
    - it is daytime; and  
    - visibility is at least 5km; and  
    - cloud ceiling is 1000ft or more; and  
    - tailwind component does not exceed 5 kt; and  
    - traffic information is provided to the following aircraft; and  
    - the runway is dry or the braking action is assessed as 'good'

### Behind a preceding departing aircraft
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold until the preceding departing aircraft:  
    - has either commenced a turn; or  
    - is beyond the point on the runway at which the landing aircraft could be expected to complete its landing roll and there is sufficient distance to enable the landing aircraft to manoeuvre safely in the event of a missed approach.

### After intersecting runway traffic
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold until a preceding departing or landing aircraft on an intersecting runway has either crossed the intersection or stopped short
