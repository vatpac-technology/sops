## Takeoff
### Behind a preceding departing aircraft
#### Main Standard
- Preceding departing aircraft;  
    - has crossed the up-wind end of the runway-in-use; or  
    - has commenced a turn; or  
    - is airborne and has reached a point at least **1800m (6000ft)** ahead of the following aircraft provided the runway is longer than **1800m (6000ft)**; and  
    - [Wake Turbulence](#wake-turbulence) requirements are met

#### 600m Standard
- Preceding departing aircraft;  
    - is airborne and has reached a point at least **600m (2000ft)** ahead of the following aircraft provided:  
        - the preceding aircraft is `Light` Wake Turbulence Category;  
        - the following aircraft has an MTOW of less than **2000kg**; and  
        - the following aircraft is slower than the preceding aircraft; or  
    - is airborne and has reached a point at least **600m (2000ft)** ahead of the following aircraft provided both aircraft have an MTOW of less than **2000kg**

### Behind a preceding landing aircraft
- Preceding landing aircraft has vacated and is taxiing away from the runway

### Behind landing or departing aircraft on intersecting runways
- Preceding departing aircraft on an intersecting runway has crossed the intersection; or  
- An aircraft landing on the crossing runway has either crossed the intersection or stopped short.

### After aircraft has departed in the opposite direction
- Preceding aircraft has crossed the point at which the following aircraft will commence take-off

## Landing
### Behind a preceding landing aircraft
#### Main Standard
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold unless:  
    - the preceding aircraft has vacated and is taxiing away from the runway, and  
    - [Wake Turbulence](#wake-turbulence) requirements are met

#### 600m Standard
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold unless:  
    - the preceding aircraft has landed and has passed a point at least 600 m from the threshold of the runway, is in motion and will vacate the runway without backtracking, and  
    - the preceding aircraft is `Light` Wake Turbulence Category; and  
    - the following aircraft has an MTOW of **2000kg** or less

#### 1000m Standard
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold unless:  
    - the landing aircraft has an MTOW below **3000kg** and is a Performance **Category A** aircraft; and  
    - the preceding aircraft aircraft is `Light` Wake Turbulence Category, is at least **1000m** from the threshold of the runway, and will vacate the runway without backtracking

#### 2400m Standard
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold unless:  
    - the preceding aircraft has landed and has passed a point at least **2400m** from the threshold of the runway; and  
    - the preceding aircraft is in motion and will vacate the runway without backtracking, and  
    - the preceding aircraft is `Medium`, `Heavy` or `Super` Wake Turbulence Category; and  
    - it is daytime; and  
    - visibility is at least **5km**; and  
    - cloud ceiling is **1000ft** or more; and  
    - tailwind component does not exceed **5kt**; and  
    - traffic information is provided to the following aircraft; and  
    - the runway is dry

!!! tip
The 'ASMGCS_RWY_RSM' Ground Map in vatSys adds markings 2400m from the runway threshold at approved aerodromes, and may assist with the application of this standard.


### Behind a preceding departing aircraft
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold until the preceding departing aircraft:  
    - has either commenced a turn; or  
    - is beyond the point on the runway at which the landing aircraft could be expected to complete its landing roll and there is sufficient distance to enable the landing aircraft to manoeuvre safely in the event of a missed approach.

#### 1000m Standard
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold unless:  
    - the landing aircraft has an MTOW below **3000kg** and is a Performance **Category A** aircraft; and  
    - the preceding aircraft aircraft is `Light` Wake Turbulence Category, is at least **1000m** from the threshold of the runway, and  
    - has commenced its take-off run

### After intersecting runway traffic
- Landing aircraft may not cross the runway threshold until a preceding departing or landing aircraft on an intersecting runway has either crossed the intersection or stopped short
