## Categories

| Category | MTOW |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Super **(J)** | **A388** and **A225** |
| Heavy **(H)** | **136,000kg** or Greater *(Excluding A388 and A225)* |
| Medium **(M)** | Between **7,000kg** and **136,000kg** |
| Light **(L)** | **7,000kg** or Less |

## Exceptions
Wake Turbulence Separation is **not required**:

- When the following aircraft has the same or heavier wake turbulence category as the preceding aircraft;
    - Except **Heavy** following **Heavy**
- Between an aircraft landing behind an aircraft taking-off on the same runway;
- For airborne VFR aircraft (**Runway** Wake Turbulence still applies);
- For aircraft that have accepted responsibility for visual separation with another aircraft; or
- For a helicopter conducting an air taxi

## Runways
### Departures
#### Full length or Crossing Runway Operations
Apply to departing aircraft when:

- Both aircraft are using the same runway for take-off; or
- An aircraft is taking off behind a preceding departing or arriving
aircraft on a crossing runway

| Lead Aircraft | Following Aircraft | Time (min) | Distance (nm)|
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Super | Heavy | 2 | 6 |
|  | Medium | 3 | 7 |
|  | Light | 3 | 8 |
| Heavy | Heavy | - | 4 |
|  | Medium | 2 | 5 |
|  | Light | 2 | 6 |
| Medium | Light | 2 | 5 |

#### Intermediate Departures
Apply to departing aircraft from a non-full-length intersection when:

- The following aircraft will depart; or
- The following aircraft will conduct a touch-and-go

| Lead Aircraft | Following Aircraft | Time (min) |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Super | Heavy | 4 |
|  | Medium | 4 |
|  | Light | 4 |
| Heavy | Medium | 3 |
|  | Light | 3 |
| Medium | Light | 3 |

### Arrivals
#### Full length or Crossing Runway Operations
Apply to arriving aircraft when:

- Both aircraft are using the same runway for landing; or
- An aircraft will fly/land through the approach/landing path of an aircraft on a crossing runway

| Lead Aircraft | Following Aircraft | Time (min) | Distance (nm)|
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Super | Heavy | 3 | 6 |
|  | Medium | 3 | 7 |
|  | Light | 4 | 8 |
| Heavy | Heavy | - | 4 |
|  | Medium | 2 | 5 |
|  | Light | 3 | 6 |
| Medium | Light | 3 | 5 |

## Airspace
Apply to aircraft operating **directly behind** and within **760m laterally** of another aircraft

| Lead Aircraft | Following Aircraft | Distance (NM) |

| Super | Heavy | 6* | 
|  | Medium | 7* |
|  | Light | 8* |
| Heavy | Heavy | 4 |
