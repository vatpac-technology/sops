## Lateral

### 5nm
- Enroute positions

### 3nm
- ADC positions  
- TCU positions

!!! note
    The 3nm standard may be used by Enroute controllers providing top-down to a TCU, ***only if*** a seperate air display is used for the TCU position. Otherwise, 5nm standard must be used in the TCU

## Sequencing
### Enroute to TCU
Enroute must aim to have **2 minute** spacing between two arrivals at the same Feeder Fix for the **same runway**.

This distance may be reduced to an absolute minimum of **10nm**.

This includes aircraft inbound through nearby Feeder Fixes (eg: *LIZZI* and *BOYSE* at YMML) when specified by Local Instructions.

### TCU to ADC
TCU must aim to have **2-3 minute** spacing between two arrivals for the **same runway**.

This distance may be reduced to an absolute minimum of **5nm**.

## Vertical
### 500ft
- Between an IFR and VFR aircraft where;  
    - Both aircraft have `Light` Wake Turbulence Category; and  
    - Both aircraft are at or below 10,000ft; and  
    - Traffic information is passed to the IFR aircraft

### 1000ft
- Between any aircraft at or below `F290`  
- Between 2 RVSM-approved aircraft at or below `F410`

### 2000ft
- Between any aircraft that is experiencing Severe Turbulence at any level  
- Between all aircraft above `F410`  
- Between `F290` and `F410` inclusive;  
    - When at least 1 aircraft is not RVSM-approved  
    - Between military formation aircraft, regardless of RVSM status

### 3000ft
- When at least one aircraft is supersonic
