## Airspace
The limits of the SG TCU are `SFC` to `F245` within 40 NM of the YBSG ARP. This may be amended by NOTAM.

By default, SG APP owns the Class C airspace within the SG MIL CTR `A015`-`A040`, as well as the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- R604A (`A040`-`F125`)  
- R604B (`F125`-`F245`)  
- R605A (`A040`-`F125`)   
- R604B (`F125`-`F245`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when SG APP is active.

!!! note
    See [VATPAC NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} for active NOTAMs which may affect military operations.

## Coordination
### ADC
#### Airspace
SG ADC owns the Class C airspace within the SG CTR from `SFC` to `A015`.

#### Departures
[Next](../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from SG ADC to SG TCU for all aircraft.

The Standard Assignable Level from  **SG ADC** to **SG TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------- | ------- |
| All | The lower of `F240` and `RFL` | 

### ISA(ARA)
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from SG TCU to ARA for aircraft:  
Planned at or above `F245`: `Assigned F240`  
Planned below `F245`: `Assigned the RFL`  

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**SG TCU** -> **ARA**</span>: "ASY219, with your concurrence, will be assigned F200, for my separation with ASY404"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARA** -> **SG TCU**</span>: "ASY219, concur F200"  

#### Arrivals
The Standard assignable level from ARA to SG TCU is `F130`, and tracking via WP VOR. All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.
