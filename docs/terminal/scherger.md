| **Scherger TCU**   | **Scherger Approach**   | **124.200**        | **SG_APP**                                   |

## Airspace
The limits of the **SG TCU** are `SFC` to `F245` within 40 NM of the YBSG ARP. This may be amended by NOTAM.

**SG ADC** owns the airspace within the SG CTR from `SFC` to `A015` with a **5nm radius** around YBSG.

By default, SG APP owns the Class C airspace within the SG MIL CTR `A015`-`A040`, as well as the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- R604A (`A040`-`F125`)  
- R604B (`F125`-`F245`)  
- R605A (`A040`-`F125`)   
- R604B (`F125`-`F245`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when SG APP is active.

!!! note
    See [VATPAC NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} for active NOTAMs which may affect military operations.

## Local Procedures
### Weipa (YBWP)
SG TCU is responsible for clearances into and out of Weipa (YBWP), which sits inside the Scherger Class C control zone when active.

!!! note
    While SG TCU is responsible for the airspace from `SFC` to `F245` above YBWP, they have **no jurisdiction** over the runways, taxiways, or apron areas on the aerodrome itself.

#### Departures
Outbound aircraft will report when taxiing for departure to **SG TCU**. Controllers shall issue the aircraft with a squawk code and a traffic statement regarding any aircraft operating on, or shortly to land at, the aerodrome.

!!! note
    Both VFR and IFR aircraft require a clearance to operate in Class C airspace.  The examples below show an IFR aircraft departing.

!!! phraseology
    **QLK479D:** "Scherger Approach, QLK479D, Dash 8, IFR, taxiing YBWP for YBCS, runway 12"  
    **SG TCU:** "QLK479D, squawk 4432, no reported traffic, report lined up for airways clearance"  
    **QLK479D:** "Squawk 4432, wilco, QLK479D"

When the aircraft reports ready, and where no conflict exists, issue airways clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **QLK479D:** "QLK479D, lined up"  
    **SG TCU:** "QLK479D, cleared to YBCS via GUPDA, flight plan route, climb to F230, make right turn, report airborne"  
    **QLK479D:** "Cleared to YBCS via GUPDA, flight plan route, climb to F230, make right turn, QLK479D" 

All surface areas at YBWP are **outside TCU's jurisdiction**. Takeoff clearances are not given.

!!! phraseology
    **QLK479D:** "QLK479D, passing `A012`, climbing to `F230`"  
    **SG TCU:** "QLK479D, identified"

Where a delay is required, withhold clearance until a suitable separation standard exists.

!!! phraseology
    **QLK479D:** "QLK479D, lined up"  
    **SG TCU:** "QLK479D, short delay due to traffic inbound to YBSG"  
    **QLK479D:** "QLK479D"


#### Arrivals
Inbound aircraft should be given an airways clearance by SG TCU (if not entering from ENR CTA). Aircraft may be cleared for a visual approach or one of Weipa's instrument approaches.

As a **landing clearance is not given**, aircraft should instead be informed of any traffic operating on the aerodrome and instructed to *'report clear of the runway'*, when their SARWATCH (for IFR aircraft) should be terminated.

!!! phraseology
    **FD491:** "FD491, visual"  
    **SG TCU:** "FD491, cleared visual approach, no reported traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **FD491:** "Cleared visual approach, FD491"  

    **FD491**: "FD491, clear of the runway, YBWP, cancel SARWATCH"  
    **SG TCU**: "FD491, YBWP SARWATCH terminated"

## Coordination
### ADC
#### Airspace
SG ADC owns the Class C airspace within the SG CTR from `SFC` to `A015`.

#### Departures
[Next](../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from SG ADC to SG TCU for all aircraft.

The Standard Assignable Level from  **SG ADC** to **SG TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------- | ------- |
| All | The lower of `F240` and `RFL` | 

### ISA(ARA)
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from SG TCU to ARA for aircraft:  
Planned at or above `F245`: `Assigned F240`  
Planned below `F245`: `Assigned the RFL`  

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**SG TCU** -> **ARA**</span>: "ASY219, with your concurrence, will be assigned F200, for my separation with ASY404"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARA** -> **SG TCU**</span>: "ASY219, concur F200"  

#### Arrivals
The Standard assignable level from ARA to SG TCU is `F130`, and tracking via WP VOR. All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.
