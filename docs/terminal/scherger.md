The limits of the SG TCU are `SFC` to `F245` within 40 NM of the YBSG ARP. This may be amended by NOTAM.

By default, SG APP owns the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- R604A (`A040`-`F125`)  
- R604B (`F125`-`F245`)  
- R605A (`A040`-`F125`)   
- R604B (`F125`-`F245`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when SG APP is active.

## Coordination
### SG TCU / SG ADC

'Next' coordination is required from SG ADC to SG TCU for all aircraft.

### SG TCU / ISA(ARA) 
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from SG TCU to ISA(ARA) for aircraft:  
Planned at or above `F280`: `Assigned F280`  
Planned below `F280`: `Assigned the RFL`  

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**SG TCU** -> **ISA(ARA)**</span>: "QFA1601, with your concurrence, will be assigned F160, for my separation with JTE654"  
    <span class="hotline">**ISA(ARA)** -> **SG TCU**</span>: "PFY1234, concur F160"  

#### Arrivals
The Standard assignable level from ISA(ARA) to SG TCU is `F130`, and tracking via WP VOR. All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.

!!! note
    Additional charts to the AIP may be found in the RAAF TERMA document, available towards the bottom of [RAAF AIP page](https://ais-af.airforce.gov.au/australian-aip){target=new}
