## Airspace
### Default
By default, WLM TCU owns the airspace within the WLM MIL CTR `SFC` to `F125`. This may be amended by NOTAM.

When WLM TCU is active above `F125` by ad-hoc release or NOTAM, WLM-L_APP owns the airspace `SFC` to `F125`, while WLM APP owns the rest of WLM TCU airspace above `F125`. This may be adjusted as required with coordination.

!!! note
    It is the responsibility of the WLM TCU controller(s) to negotiate any airspace releases with ARL(All).

### ADC
When WLM ADC is online, they own the airspace within the WLM MIL CTR A (`SFC`-`A050`). This may be amended/released as required between WLM ADC and WLM TCU.

## Charts
!!! note
    Additional charts to the AIP may be found in the RAAF TERMA document, available towards the bottom of [RAAF AIP page](https://ais-af.airforce.gov.au/australian-aip){target=new}

## Coordination
### ARL(All)

#### Airspace
Any airspace releases from the default setup must be coordinated and agreed upon with ARL. It is also good practice to remind them of any airspace releases that may be active due to NOTAMs.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F120` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to ARL CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated by WLM TCU prior to the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **MLD**</span>: "QJE1597, request DCT OMGAB"  
    <span class="hotline">**MLD** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "QJE1597, concur DCT OMGAB"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YWLM**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A090`

All other aircraft coming from ARL CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated to WLM TCU.

### ADC
#### Airspace
WLM ADC owns the airspace within the WLM MIL CTR A (`SFC`-`A050`). This may be amended/released as required between WLM ADC and WLM TCU.

#### Departures
'Next' coordination is **not** required from WLM ADC to WLM TCU for aircraft that are:  
a) Departing from a runway nominated in the ATIS; and  
b) Assigned the standard assignable level;  
c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID  

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**WLM ADC** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "Next, MVP"  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **WLM ADC**</span>: "MVP, Left Heading 010, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM ADC** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "Left Heading 010, MVP"  

The Standard Assignable level from WLM ADC to WLM TCU is the lower of `F120` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless coordination is in place from WLM TCU to WLM ADC for arrivals cleared for an approach on to a runway nominated on the ATIS. All other aircraft and all overfliers must be heads-up coordinated as soon as practical.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **WLM ADC**</span>: "via WLM, ZULU, Close formation of 5, do you have any restrictions or requirements?”  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM ADC** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "ZULU, no restrictions or requirements, A040"
