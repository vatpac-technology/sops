## Airspace
The Vertical limits of the BN TCU are `SFC` to `F180`, except in BAC airspace, where it is `SFC` to `A075` in the North West, and `SFC` to `F125` in the South East.

### Reclassifications
#### AF CTR
AF CTR reverts to Class G when **AF ADC** is offline, and is administered by the relevant BN TCU controller.

See also: [AF ADC Offline](#af-adc-offline).

#### CG CTR
If BN TCU elects not to provide top-down to YBCG, The CG CTR Class C airspace `SFC` to `A035` reverts to Class G when **CG ADC** is offline, and is administered by the relevant BN TCU controller.

See also: [CG ADC Offline](#cg-adc-offline).
  
### Airspace Structural Arrangements
Pursuant to Section 3 of the [VATPAC Air Traffic Services Policy](https://cdn.vatpac.org/documents/policy/Controller+Positions+and+Ratings+Policy+v5.2.pdf), **“North”**/**”West”** positions shall assume the airspace of corresponding **“South”**/**”East”** positions when the latter are inactive (e.g. **BAN** assumes **BAS** airspace), and vice versa.

### Airspace Division
The divisions of the airspace between **BAN**, **BAS**, **BDS**, **BDN**, and **BAC** change based on the Runway Mode.

!!! note
    The following diagrams do not include non BN TCU areas of responsibility such as AF CTR or CG ADC

## Parallel Runway Operations
Refer to [Parallel Runway Separation Standards](../../separation-standards/parallelapps) for more information

### Runway Selection
Aircraft shall be assigned the following runways for arrival when PROPS are in progress:

| FF | Runway |
| ---- | -------- |
| BLAKA | 01R/19L |
| GOMOL | 01R/19L |
| UGTUG | 01R/**19R** |
| TEBOT | 01R/**19R** |
| MORBI | 01L/19R |
| SMOKA | 01L/19R |
| WOODY | 01L/19R |
| ENLIP | 01L/**19L** |
| Other aircraft: |
| From the NORTH and WEST | 01L/19R |
| From the SOUTH and EAST | 01R/19L |

These standard runway assignments may be modified strategically by the BAS or BFL controller.

!!! example
    If during an event, the vast majority of traffic is coming from **BLAKA** and **GOMOL** feeder fixes, BAS/BFL may elect to assign 19L to **BLAKA** arrivals and 19R to **GOMOL** arrivals, to keep them separated at all times.

    <span class="hotline">**BFL** -> **INL**</span>: "All arrivals via GOMOL to be assigned 19R until further notice"  
    <span class="hotline">**INL** -> **BFL**</span>: "Roger, Arrivals via GOMOL to be assigned 19R" 

### Independent Visual Approach Phraseology at Night
*"CLEARED INDEPENDENT VISUAL APPROACH RUNWAY (number), NOT BELOW (altitude) UNTIL ESTABLISHED ON THE PAPI (or GLIDEPATH)"*

## AF ADC Offline
Due to the low level of CTA (`A015`) in the AF CTR when **AF ADC** is offline, it is best practice to give airways clearance to aircraft at the holding point, to ensure departing aircraft can have uninterrupted climb.

!!! example
    **ABC**: "Brisbane Approach, ABC, PC12, POB 8, IFR, Taxiing YBAF for YBSU, Runway 28R"   
    **BN TCU**: "ABC, Brisbane Approach, Squawk 3601, No Reported IFR Traffic, Report Ready at the Holding Point for Airways Clearance"  
    **ABC**: "Squawk 3601, Wilco, ABC"  

    **ABC**: "ABC, Ready Runway 28R, Request clearance"  
    **BN TCU**: "ABC, Cleared to YBSU via BN, Flight Planned Route. Make Visual right turn DCT BN, Climb to A030"  
    **ABC**: "Cleared to YBSU via BN, Flight Planned Route. Make Visual right turn DCT BN, Climb to A030, ABC"

## CG ADC Offline
Due to the low level of CTA (`A035`) in the CG CTR when **CG ADC** is offline, it is best practice to give airways clearance to aircraft at the holding point, to ensure departing aircraft can have uninterrupted climb.

!!! example
    **JST446**: "Brisbane Approach, JST446, A320, IFR, Taxiing YBCG for YSSY, Runway 214"   
    **BN TCU**: "JST446, Brisbane Approach, Squawk 3601, No Reported IFR Traffic, Report Ready at the Holding Point for Airways Clearance"  
    **JST446**: "Squawk 3601, Wilco, JST446"  

    **JST446**: "JST446, Ready Runway 14, Request clearance"  
    **BN TCU**: "JST446, Cleared to YSSY via APAGI, Flight Planned Route. Climb to A060"  
    **JST446**: "Cleared to YSSY via APAGI, Flight Planned Route. Climb to A060, JST446"

## Coordination
### Enroute
#### Departures
Voiceless for aircraft:

- With ADEP **YBBN**  
    - Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
    - Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`  
- With ADEP **YBCG**  
    - Tracking via **APAGI** and assigned the lower of `F120` or the `RFL`; or    
    - Tracking via **BN** and assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`  
- With ADES **YBSU**  
    - Assigned the **ITIDE** STAR; and  
    - Assigned `F130`

All other aircraft going to INL CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated by BN TCU prior to the boundary. This includes YBCG departures to the North that clip INL(GOL) airspace before re-entering BN TCU airspace

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BAC** -> **GOL**</span>: "Departing YBCG, X4C, do you have any Restrictions or Requirements?"  
    <span class="hotline">**GOL** -> **BAC**</span>: "X4C, No Restrictions or Requirements"  

#### Arrivals
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBBN** or **YBCG**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A090` for **YBBN** arrivals; or  
- Assigned `F130` for **YBCG** arrivals

Additionally, Voiceless coordination may be used for **YBCG** arrivals tracking via **BN** and assigned `F190`.

All other aircraft coming from INL CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated to BN TCU.

### BN ADC
#### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required from BN ADC for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS (except during SODPROPS^); and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID  

^Auto Release is not available during SODPROPS runway mode. All aircraft will be coordinated from BN ADC to BN TCU.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BN ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "Next, ABC, runway 19L"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **BN ADC**</span>: "ABC, Heading 030, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "Heading 030, ABC"

The Standard Assignable level from BN ADC to BN TCU is:  
For Jets: `A060`  
For Non-Jets: The lower of `A040` or the `RFL`

### CG ADC
#### Airspace
CG ADC is responsible for the Class C Airspace within the CG CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#cg-ctr) for operations when CG ADC is offline.

#### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required from CG ADC for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**CG ADC** -> **BAC**</span>: "Next, CBN, runway 14"  
    <span class="hotline">**BAC** -> **CG ADC**</span>: "CBN, heading 030, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CG ADC** -> **BAC**</span>: "Heading 030, CBN"  

The BN TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **CG ADC**.

The Standard Assignable level from CG ADC to BN TCU is:  
For Jets: `A060`  
For Non-Jets: The lower of `A060` or the `RFL`

### AF ADC
#### Airspace
AF ADC is responsible for the Class D Airspace within the AF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#af-ctr) for operations when AF ADC is offline.

### Departures
When aircraft planned via a CTA departure are ready for takeoff and expected to depart imminently, **AF ADC** shall seek release of the aircraft through a 'Next' call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**AF ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "Next, XMM, Runway 10L"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **AF ADC**</span>: "XMM, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**AF ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "XMM"

The Standard Assignable level from AF ADC to BN TCU is the lower of `A040` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
BN TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to AF ADC prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to AF ADC, unless AF ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **AF ADC**</span>: "via TVT for the visual approach, UJE"  
    <span class="hotline">**AF ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "UJE, visual approach"

### AMB TCU
All aircraft transiting from **BN TCU** to **AMB TCU** and vice versa must be heads-up coordinated prior to the boundary. 

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**AMB TCU** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "via BN, DRGN02"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **AMB TCU**</span>: "DRGN02, `F140`"  

For aircraft arriving into AMB TCU there is no standard assignable level and simply is what ever the controllers agree upon.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **AMB TCU**</span>: "via WACKO, STAL13, what level can I assign?"  
    <span class="hotline">**AMB TCU** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "STAL13, `A090`"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **AMB TCU**</span>: "`A090`, STAL13"  

### SU ADC
BN TCU Class G shares a tiny border with **SU ADC**, however there are no SIDs, STARs, or airways through this gap. The only possible way for an aircraft to directly enter SU ADC airspace from BN TCU's jurisdiction, is from Class G, and as such, no coordination is required to **SU ADC**. However, ensure the aircraft is transferred to the ADC at least **10nm** prior to the boundary, to facilitate their airways clearance.

**SU ADC** coordination for arrivals and departures via the SID/STAR is handled by INL(NSA).
