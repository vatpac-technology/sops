# BN TCU / ENR
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from BN TCU to all surrounding ENR sectors (ARL to the North and East, YWE to the West, BIK to the South) for aircraft:  
Planned at or above F280: `Assigned F180`  
Planned below F280: `Assigned the RFL`  
with ADES YBSU at or above ???: `Assigned F???`  
with ADES YBSU below ???: `Assigned the RFL`  

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! example
    BDS -> INL: "via GOMOL, BNZ123, with your concurrence, will be assigned F150, for my separation with ZYX"  
    INL -> BDS: "BNZ123, concur F150"  
    BDS -> INL: "F150, BNZ123" 

#### Arrivals
The Standard assignable level from ENR to ML TCU is `A090`. All other levels must be prior coordinated.

# BN TCU / BN ADC
#### Auto Release

Auto Release shall be used for aircraft that are:    
a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
b) Issued a Procedural SID; and   
c) Assigned the standard assignable level.

Any aircraft that don't meet these criteria must be coordinated to BN TCU with a "Next" Call.

"Next" Coordination is a procedure where the BN ADC controller gives a heads-up to the BN TCU controller about an impending departure. The BN TCU controller will respond by assigning a heading to the aircraft, for the BN ADC controller to pass on with their takeoff clearance.

!!! example
    BN ADC -> BN TCU: "Next, ABC"  
    BN TCU -> BN ADC: "ABC, Heading 030"  
    BN ADC -> BN TCU: "Heading 030, ABC"  
    BN ADC -> ABC: "ABC, Assigned heading right 030, Runway 34R, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    ABC -> BN ADC: "Right heading 030, Runway 34R, Cleared for Takeoff, ABC"  
    `AIP GEN 3.4 6.16.6 3f`

# BN TCU / AF TWR
#### Departures

Aircraft departing YSBK in to BN TCU will be coordinated from BK TWR at Taxi. Aircraft that will enter the BN TCU Class C airspace need to be passed airways clearances to BK TWR at this point, to be relayed to the aircraft.

!!! example
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "Taxi, TFX12 for YMML via WOL"  
    BN TCU -> BK TWR: "TFX12, BK, WOL, Flight Planned Route, A030, Squawk 3601"  
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "BK, WOL, Flight Planned Route, A030, Squawk 3601, TFX12"  
    BK TWR Will then pass the airways clearance to TFX12

BK TWR will then give a "Next" call, where the BN TCU controller shall assign a heading (usually 290, for separation from YSBN).

!!! example
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "Next, TFX12"  
    BN TCU -> BK TWR: "TFX12, Right Heading 290, A030"  
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "Right Heading 290, A030, TFX12"  
    BK TWR Will then clear the aircraft to takeoff with the assigned heading, and instruct them to contact BN TCU passing A020.

#### Arrivals

YSBK arrivals shall be coordinated to BK TWR from BN TCU prior to 10 minutes from entering the BK CTR.

!!! tip
    Ensure the aircraft's FDR is up-to-date in order to give BK TWR maximum situational awareness of the traffic picture. (eg. if the aircraft is doing the RNP approach, ensure the FDR has been rerouted via the appropriate points)

!!! example
    BN TCU -> BK TWR: "Estimate, ABC, Estimating YSBK time 26, via ODALE"  
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "ABC via ODALE"  

# BN TCU / AMB APP
#### Departures

Aircraft departing YSCN in to BN TCU will be coordinated from CN TWR at Taxi. BN TCU will issue the Squawk code.

!!! example
    CN TWR -> BN TCU: "Taxi, DEF for YBTH via KADOM"  
    BN TCU -> CN TWR: "DEF, Squawk 3601."  
    CN TWR -> BN TCU: "Squawk 3601, DEF"  

CN TWR will then give a "Next" call.

!!! example
    CN TWR -> BN TCU: "Next, DEF"  
    BN TCU -> CN TWR: "DEF"  
#### Arrivals

YSCN arrivals shall be coordinated to CN TWR from BN TCU prior to 10 minutes from entering the CN CTR.

!!! example
    BN TCU -> CN TWR: "Estimate, ZYX, Estimating YSCN time 53, via TONTO"  
    CN TWR -> BN TCU: "ZYX via TONTO"  
# BN TCU / SU TWR
#### Departures

Aircraft departing YSBK in to BN TCU will be coordinated from BK TWR at Taxi. Aircraft that will enter the BN TCU Class C airspace need to be passed airways clearances to BK TWR at this point, to be relayed to the aircraft.

!!! example
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "Taxi, TFX12 for YMML via WOL"  
    BN TCU -> BK TWR: "TFX12, BK, WOL, Flight Planned Route, A030, Squawk 3601"  
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "BK, WOL, Flight Planned Route, A030, Squawk 3601, TFX12"  
    BK TWR Will then pass the airways clearance to TFX12

BK TWR will then give a "Next" call, where the BN TCU controller shall assign a heading (usually 290, for separation from YSBN).

!!! example
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "Next, TFX12"  
    BN TCU -> BK TWR: "TFX12, Right Heading 290, A030"  
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "Right Heading 290, A030, TFX12"  
    BK TWR Will then clear the aircraft to takeoff with the assigned heading, and instruct them to contact BN TCU passing A020.

#### Arrivals

YSBK arrivals shall be coordinated to BK TWR from BN TCU prior to 10 minutes from entering the BK CTR.

!!! tip
    Ensure the aircraft's FDR is up-to-date in order to give BK TWR maximum situational awareness of the traffic picture. (eg. if the aircraft is doing the RNP approach, ensure the FDR has been rerouted via the appropriate points)

!!! example
    BN TCU -> BK TWR: "Estimate, ABC, Estimating YSBK time 26, via ODALE"  
    BK TWR -> BN TCU: "ABC via ODALE"
