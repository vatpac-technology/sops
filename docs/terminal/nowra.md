## Airspace
NW TCU owns the airspace within R421, `SFC` to `F125`. Where traffic levels (primarily preplanned military operations) warrant, NW TCU may request a release of R420F from `F125` to `F300` from BIK, if online.

## Logon Process
Due to the temporary nature of the airspace, surrounding controllers may not be aware of the lateral or vertical boundaries of the TMA. Therefore, when a controller logs on as Nowra TMA, it is important to announce that R421 is activated from SFC to F125.

!!! note
    Surrounding controllers (i.e. BIK & SY TCU) can display the lateral limits of the NW TCU by activating R421 in their Restricted Areas window.

Where it is deemed operationally beneficial to activate R420F, this should be requested from the overlying enroute controller. 

!!! important
    Activating R420F increases the workload of the overlying enroute controller by altering the airspace normally available to them for civil aircraft. Only activate this airspace if operationally necessary, primarily for preplanned military exercises.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**NW TCU** -> **BIK**</span>: "There's a preplanned military exercise about to commence, request release of R420F up to F300"  
    <span class="hotline">**BIK** -> **NW TCU**</span>: "R420F released to you F125 to F300"  
    <span class="hotline">**NW TCU** -> **BIK**</span>: "R420F released F125 to F300"  

## VFR Lane of Entry
A lane of entry exists allowing VFR aircraft to transit the TMA in a north-south orientiation. A clearance is required to operate along the lane. Where the adjacent M440A/B airspace is activated, alternate tracking is required to remain clear. Aircraft should generally be cleared along the lane at an altitude not exceeding `A020`.
