## Airspace
The PEA TMA's lateral boundaries are defined by a 20-nautical mile arc within R155A/M166 and the southern boundary of R153. Vertically, it extends from the 'SFC' to 'A050' feet within R155A/M166 and to NOTOAM within R153.

## Coordination
### PIY
#### Airspace
Any airspace releases from the default setup must be coordinated and agreed upon with PIY. It is also good practice to remind them of any airspace releases that may be active due to NOTAMs.

## Merlo Release
Merlo Airspace is released to Pearce TMA when duty runways are RWY 36L/R. PEA TMA takes other the PTH airspace that lies within 9-10 TAC above R153, for 'SFC' to 'A040'. If Merlo Release is inactive, instrument approaches will be delayed or denied.

## Gnangara Release
Gnangara Airspace is released to Pearace TMA when duty runways are RWY 36L/R or RWY 5 and Merlo Release is unaviliable. PEA TMA takes other the PTH airspace between 9-11 DME of Perth from 'SFC' to 'A010.'
