## Airspace

The limits of the CIN TCU are `SFC` to `F200` within 25 DME CIN. This may be amended by NOTAM.

By default, CIN APP owns the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- R801A (Partial) (`SFC`-`A035`)  
- R802A (`A035`-`F200`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when CIN APP is active.

    See [VATPAC NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} for active NOTAMs which may affect military operations.

## Coordination
### CIN TCU / CIN ADC

'Next' coordination is required from CIN ADC to CIN TCU for all aircraft.

### CIN TCU / TRT(KIY) 
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from CIN TCU to TRT(KIY) for aircraft:  
Planned at or above `F200`: `Assigned F200`  
Planned below `F200`: `Assigned the RFL`  

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**CIN TCU** -> **TRT(KIY)**</span>: "QFA1601, with your concurrence, will be assigned F160, for my separation with JTE654"  
    <span class="hotline">**TRT(KIY)** -> **CIN TCU**</span>: "PFY1234, concur F160"  

#### Arrivals
The Standard assignable level from TRT(KIY) to CIN TCU is `F130`, and tracking via CIN VOR. All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.
