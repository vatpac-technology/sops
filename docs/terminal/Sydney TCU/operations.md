## Airspace
The Sydney TMA spans a 45nm Radius around YSSY from SFC-FL280.  
SY TCU is responsible for the Sydney TMA, except:  
a) BK CTR when **BK TWR** is online;  
b) CN CTR when **CN TWR** is online;  
c) R470 Restricted Area, when RIC TWR is online (or as negotiated)  
d) any airspace released to an external unit (e.g. tower) either by NOTAM or as negotiated.

BK CTR reverts to Class G when **BK TWR** is offline, and is administered by the relevant SY TCU controller.    
CN CTR reverts to Class G when **CN TWR** is offline, and is administered by the relevant SY TCU controller.  
SY TCU is responsible for the provision of ADC, SMC and ACD responsibilities when **SY TWR** is offline.
#### Airspace Structural Arrangements

Pursuant to Section 3 of the [VATPAC Ratings and Controller Positions Policy](https://cdn.vatpac.org/documents/policy/Controller+Positions+and+Ratings+Policy+v5.2.pdf){target=new}, the following rules apply, in the order presented, to these controller positions, except **SFL**:  
a) **“North”**/**”West”** positions shall assume the airspace of corresponding **“South”**/**”East”** positions when the latter are inactive (e.g. **SAN** assumes **SAS** airspace), and vice versa;  
b) Approach assumes Director/Departure airspace “on-side” when the latter positions are inactive (e.g. with **SAS** and **SAN** online only, **SAS** assumes **SDS** and **SFW**) 
## Arrival Procedures
#### Level Assignment
When assigning levels on descent to aircraft, remember that you will not receive "Next" Coordination on aircraft assigned Standard Assignable Levels (ie `A050` for Jets, `A030` for Non-Jets), meaning an aircraft could depart at any time without prior warning and climb to `A050`. So in order to assure separation between arrivals and departures, do not assign below `A060` to aircraft until they are clear of the active runway's departure path.

!!! example
    For an aircraft inbound from the north on the BOREE3A arrival Runway 34R, assign no lower than `A060` until south of the field, then lower as required
### Parallel Runway Operations

#### Runway Selection
Unless operationally required, aircraft shall be assigned the following runways for arrival when PROPS are in progress:

| Aircraft tracking | Runway  |
| ----------------| --------- |
| via RIVET   | 16R/34L      |
| via ODALE | 16R/34L |
| via MARLN | 16L/34R |
| via BOREE | 16L/34R |
| via MEPIL | 16L/34R |
| Other aircraft: |
| From the NORTH and EAST | 16L/34R |
| From the SOUTH and WEST | 16R/34L |

#### Director East and West

Sydney Approach North (SAN) / Sydney Approach South (SAS) are required to hand-off aircraft to the appropriate Sydney Director East (SFE) / Sydney Director West (SFW) Controller on a <u>downwind heading</u>, <u>assigned</u> (or maintaining) <u>6000FT</u>.

Note - the downwind heading is not required to be entered in the label data by SAN/SAS.

SFW/SFE should provide aircraft an approximate 'miles to run' on first contact, to allow the aircraft to plan their descent path.

A typical downwind will take roughly 25 track miles from the normal point have handover from SAN/SAS to SFE/SFW.

!!! example
    "QLK402, Sydney Director, descend via STAR 4000 FT, 25 miles to run"

SFW/SFE may provide distance to touchdown, when transferring an aircraft to tower after the aircraft is established on their approach runway centreline (see below).

!!! example
    "QFA490, 8 miles to touchdown, contact tower 120.5"

#### Instrument Approach

Aim to vector aircraft to the following Intercept points during instrument PROPS (GLS or ILS approach):

| Runway | Distance from Threshold | Level  |
| --| ----------------| --------- |
|RWY 16R/34L| 10nm   | A030     |
|RWY 16L/34R| 15nm or further | A040 |

#### Independent Visual Approach

When conducting IVAs, aircraft shall not be transferred to **SY ADC** until established on final.

!!! example
    **SFW:** “BNZ444, Turn left heading 360, join final Runway 34L, from that heading Cleared Independent Visual Approach, report on final” `AIP GEN 3.4`   
    **BNZ444:** "Left heading 360, join final Runway 34L, from that heading Cleared Independent Visual Approach, wilco, BNZ444"  
    ...  
    **BNZ444:** "BNZ444, on final"  
    **SFW:** "BNZ444, Contact Sydney Tower 120.5"  
    **BNZ444:** "120.5, BNZ444" 

## Sydney Harbour Scenic Flights
Flights may be cleared for one of two standard scenic flight routes at `A015`, **Harbour Scenic ONE** or **Harbour Scenic TWO**, which are described below. Pilot preference should be accommodated where traffic permits.

Aircraft must Track via Class G airspace to Long Reef and contact SY TCU prior to reaching Long Reef requesting a ‘Harbour Scenic’ clearance. If a clearance cannot be given immediately, instruct the pilot to remain in Class G airspace

!!! example
    “ABC, remain outside Class C airspace and standby”

A **‘Harbour Scenic ONE’** (or **‘TWO’**) clearance is used to authorise flight in the nominated route at `A015`. Sydney Airport QNH must be issued with the clearance.

!!! example
    “ABC, Cleared Harbour Scenic One, Sydney QNH 1014”

These can be displayed on vatSys using the SY_VFR map.
## BK TWR Offline
Due to the low level of CTA (A015) in the BK CTR when **BK TWR** is offline, it is best practice to give airways clearance to aircraft at the holding point, to ensure departing aircraft can have uninterrupted climb.

!!! example
    **ABC** -> **SY TCU**: "Sydney Approach, ABC, PC12, POB 8, IFR, Taxiing YSBK for YSHL, Runway 11C" `AIP GEN 3.4`  
    **SY TCU** -> **ABC**: "ABC, Sydney Approach, Squawk 3601, No Reported IFR Traffic, Call me Ready at the Holding Point for Airways Clearance"  
    **ABC** -> **SY TCU**: "Squawk 3601, Wilco, ABC"  
    **ABC** -> **SY TCU**: "ABC, Ready Runway 11C, Request clearance"  
    **SY TCU** -> **ABC**: "ABC, Cleared to YSHL via ANKUB, Flight Planned Route. Make Visual right turn DCT ANKUB, Climb to A030"  
    **ABC** -> **SY TCU**: "Cleared to YSHL via ANKUB, Flight Planned Route. Make Visual right turn DCT ANKUB, Climb to A030, ABC" 
## Airspace Division

The divisions of the airspace between **SAN**, **SAS**, **SDS**, **SDN**, **SFW** and **SFE** change based on the Runway Mode.

    The following diagrams do not include non SY TCU areas of responsibility such as BK CTR or CN CTR
