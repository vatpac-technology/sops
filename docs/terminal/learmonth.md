## Airspace

The limits of the LM TCU are `SFC` to `F280` within 40 DME LM. This may be amended by NOTAM.

By default, LM APP owns the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- R859A (`A045`-`A100`)  
- R859B (`A100`-`F280`)  
- R860A (`A015`-`A025`)  
- R860B (`A025`-`F280`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when LM APP is active.

!!! note
    See [VATPAC NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} for active NOTAMs which may affect military operations.

## Coordination
### LM ADC

'Next' coordination is required from LM ADC to LM TCU for all aircraft.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**LM ADC** -> **LM TCU**</span>: "Next, QFA1601, runway 36"  
    <span class="hotline">**LM TCU** -> **LM ADC**</span>: "QFA1601, Right heading 060 Visual, unrestricted"  

### OLW 
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from LM TCU to OLW for aircraft:  
Planned at or above `F270`: `Assigned F270`  
Planned below `F270`: `Assigned the RFL`  

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**LM TCU** -> **OLW**</span>: "QFA1601, with your concurrence, will be assigned F160, for my separation with JTE654"  
    <span class="hotline">**OLW** -> **LM TCU**</span>: "QFA1601, concur F160"  

#### Arrivals
The Standard assignable level from OLW to LM TCU is `F130`, and tracking via LM VOR. All other aircraft must be prior coordinated.
