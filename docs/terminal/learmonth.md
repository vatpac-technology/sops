## Airspace
The limits of the LM TCU are `SFC` to `F280` within 40 DME LM. This may be amended by NOTAM.

By default, LM APP owns the Class C airspace within the LM CTR `A015`-`A025`, as well as the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- M858A (`A045`-`A100`)  
- M858B (`A100`-`F280`)
- M869B (`A100`-`F250`)
- R860A (`A015`-`A025`)  
- R860B (`A025`-`F280`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when LM APP is active.

    See [VATPAC NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} for active NOTAMs which may affect military operations.

## Coordination
### ADC
#### Airspace
LM ADC owns the Class C airspace within the LM CTR from `SFC` to `A015`.

#### Departures
[Next](../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from LM ADC to LM TCU for all aircraft.

The Standard Assignable Level from  **LM ADC** to **LM TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |

| All | The lower of `F270` and `RFL` | 

### OLW 
#### Departures
Voiceless coordination is in place from LM TCU to OLW for aircraft assigned the lower of `F270` and `RFL`.

Any aircraft not meeting the above criteria must be prior coordinated to ENR.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**LMA** -> **OLW**</span>: "QFA1601, with your concurrence, will be assigned F160, for my separation with JTE654"  
    <span class="hotline">**OLW** -> **LMA**</span>: "QFA1601, concur F160"
