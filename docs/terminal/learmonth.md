## Airspace
The limits of the LM TCU are `SFC` to `F280` within 40 DME LM. This may be amended by NOTAM.

By default, LM APP owns the Class C airspace within the LM MIL CTR `A015`-`A025`, as well as the following Restricted Areas, as detailed below:

- R859A (`A045`-`A100`)  
- R859B (`A100`-`F280`)  
- R860A (`A015`-`A025`)  
- R860B (`A025`-`F280`)  

The above Restricted Areas are classified as Class C when LM APP is active.
