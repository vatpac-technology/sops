## Runway Modes
**16 PROPS** and **34 PROPS** are the *preferred* Runway Modes, with equal preference.

If winds dictate that 07/25 Single Runway operations are required, this is acceptable (but not preferred), as a single runway is in use for arrivals at YPAD.

## Airways Clearance Delivery (ACD)
### Flight Plan Compliance
Ensure **all flight plans** are checked for compliance with the approved WF Route:

`DCT TESAT A576 KADOM H44 BORLI W451 MIA H309 AD DCT`

### WF Teams
[WF Teams](../../#official-team-callsigns) shall have `STS/STATE` added to their remarks, and `WF TEAM` added to their Global Ops Field, to ensure they receive priority.

### Runway Selection
By default, assign aircraft the departure runway that corresponds to their departure apron (ie, **16L/34R** on *East* Apron, **16R/34L** on *West* Apron).
