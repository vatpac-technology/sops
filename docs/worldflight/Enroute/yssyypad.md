## Sector Responsibilities
### Katoomba (KAT)
KAT will take responsibility for the BIK and GUN subsectors. No additional frequencies will need to be primed to KAT.

Some aircraft will be handed off to KAT south of route on **H260**. When it's suitable, KAT must clear these aircraft DCT **BORLI**.

#### Runway 30 at YPAD
If Runway 30 is in use for arrivals at YPAD, aircraft can be sent DCT **PADEL** for the RNP Approach Runway 30.

This will only be available for the *first few hours* of the event, while YPAD has low or no departures (Until approximately **0030Z**).

This tracking should only be issued to aircraft *south* of the flight planned route.

This tracking must **only** be issued to **Light** and **Medium** Wake Turbulence Category aircraft.

!!! tip
    Balance **PADEL** tracking at your discretion. For every aircraft KAT receives on a heading from SY DEP, send one to **BORLI**, then one to **PADEL**, and continue cycling like that.

### Griffith (GTH), Oxley (OXL)
GTH and OXL will be responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight. No sequencing actions are required.

!!! caution
    GTH should look out for aircraft converging at **BORLI** at the same time and level. Use vertical separation wherever possible.

If [Runway 30 is in use at YPAD](#runway-30-at-ypad), monitor the distribution of aircraft tracking on *Flight Planned Route* VS DCT **PADEL**.  
Aim to maintain around *2/3rds* on *Flight Planned Route*, *1/3rd* DCT **PADEL**. Reroute aircraft as required to maintain this distribution.

### Mungo (MUN)
MUN will be responsible for starting to form the sequence in to YPAD, by applying *speed control* in the cruise.

### Tailem Bend (TBD)
TBD will be responsible for issuing STAR clearances in to YPAD, and providing the final sequence to handoff to AAE.

TBD will be responsible for the TBD subsector **only**.

#### STARs
Runway 23 Arrivals shall be issued the **BLACK3A** STAR.  
Runway 05 Arrivals shall be issued the **BLACK3Z** STAR.  
Runway 30 Arrivals shall be cleared DCT **PADEL** for the RNP Approach.

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **BLACK** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to AAE is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

## Coordination
### SY TCU to KAT
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F280` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **KADOM**; or  
- South of **KADOM**, Assigned **H260**

All other aircraft going to KAT CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### TBD to AAE
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YPAD**; and  
- Assigned `A090`; and
- Assigned the **BLACK3A/23** STAR; or
- Assigned the **BLACK3Z/05** STAR; or
- Tracking DCT **PADEL**

#### Between TBD and AFL
AFL will construct the sequence via the [Arrivals List Window](../../../controller-skills/sequencing/#arrivals-list).

Appropriate annotations for the Arrivals List Window can be found [here](../../../client/annotations/#sequencingflow).

AFL must **voice coordinate** any changes to instructions after TBD has put a `<` on it.

TBD must **voice coordinate** any requests for *Track Shortening*, *CSR*, or *Victor/Xray STARs*, to AFL.

!!! tip
    If in your judgement, the request won't be available due to the sequence, there is no need to voice coordinate the requests. Just deny them.
