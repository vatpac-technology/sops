--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Sector Responsibilities
### Pingelly (PIY)
PIY has *no Restrictions or Requirements* on YPPH departures tracking DCT **ESDEG**.

### Leeman (LEA)
LEA will be responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight. No sequencing actions are required.

!!! caution
    During the 03A06D Runway Mode at YPPH, LEA should look out for aircraft converging at **ESDEG** at the same time and level. Use vertical separation wherever possible.

### Geraldton (GEL), Meekatharra (MEK), Onslow (OLW)
GEL, MEK, and OLW will be responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight. No sequencing actions are required.

Aircraft shall have their **identification terminated** on handoff to INE, and instructed to give a **PAVNU** Position Report on first contact.

!!! example
    **OLW:** "BTK6081, at PAVNU, Identification terminates. Contact Brisbane Radio 123.65 with PAVNU Position Report"  

### Indian East (INE)
INE will be responsible for ensuring [Procedural Separation](../../../separation-standards/procedural/) is in place between aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight.

!!! tip
    Since you will be busy, keep the separation as *simple* as possible. [10 minutes Longitudinal](../../../separation-standards/procedural/#same-track), or [Vertical](../../../separation-standards/procedural/#vertical). Using a mix of *Standard* and *Non-Standard* levels is **highly recommended** to assist with this

## Coordination
### PHD to LEA
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **AVNEX** or **ESDEG**

All other aircraft going to LEA CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### INE to WIIF CTR
As per [Standard IND coordination procedures](../../../oceanic/Positions/IND/#international-non-pacific), Heads-up Coordination required for all aircraft prior to **30 mins** from boundary.

!!! tip
    It may be prudent (especially if they are using vatSys) to set up a Voiceless Coordination Agreement with WIIF CTR, in order to reduce workload for both controllers.
