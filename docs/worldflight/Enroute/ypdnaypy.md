## Sector Responsibilities
### Territory South (TRS)
TRS will be responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight. No sequencing actions are required.

### Arafura (ARA)
ARA will mostly just be responsible for ensuring the separation of aircraft in the Enroute phase of flight. However, ARA may start to assist with the sequence in to AYPY by applying *speed control* after **PEBTA**.

### Port Moresby (AYPM) CTR
AYPM CTR will be responsible for issuing STAR Clearances and the final sequencing in to AYPY

#### STARs
All aircraft shall be issued the **GUMBU1** STAR.  

#### Sequencing
**All aircraft** must be instructed to cross **GUMBU** at **250 knots**, then *published STAR speeds*.

!!! note
    This instruction is not required for aircraft that have a clear gap in front of them in the sequence (>30nm).

Minimum distance between arrivals at handoff to AYPY APP is **10nm** (with no significant closing speed). It is important to try not to exceed **15nm**, due to the large number of arrivals.

## Coordination
### DAE to TRS
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`; and  
- Tracking via **RUPEG**

All other aircraft going to TRS CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated.

### AYPM CTR to AYPY APP
#### Airspace
The Vertical limits of the AYPY TCU are `SFC` to `F245`.

#### Arrivals
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **AYPY**; and  
- Assigned the **GUMBU1** STAR; and  
- Assigned `A100`

All other aircraft coming from AYPM CTR CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to AYPY TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.
