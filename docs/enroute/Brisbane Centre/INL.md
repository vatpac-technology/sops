### CPDLC

The Primary Communication Method for INL is Voice.

[CPDLC](../../controller-skills/cpdlc.md) may be used in lieu when applicable.

The CPDLC Station Code is `YINL`.

!!! tip
        Even though INL's Primary Communication Method is Voice, CPDLC may be used for Overfliers.


## Airspace

  <figcaption>Inverell Airspace</figcaption>
</figure>

GOL is responsible for the [BN TCU](../../../terminal/brisbane) when **BN TCU** is offline.  
KPL is responsible for the [RK TCU](../../../terminal/coral) when **RKA** is offline.  
INL is responsible for **DOS**, **GOL**, **SDY**, **BUR**, **NSA**, and **KPL** when they are offline.  

### Reclassifications
#### SU CTR
When **SU ADC** is offline, SU CTR (Class D `SFC` to `A045`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by NSA and BUR. Alternatively, NSA may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/sunshinecoast) if they wish (not recommended), and this must be coordinated to BUR.

#### CFS CTR
When **CFS ADC** is offline, CFS CTR (Class D `SFC` to `A045`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by MNN and INL. Alternatively, INL may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Coffs) if they wish (not recommended), and this must be coordinated to ARL(MNN).

Due to the low ceiling of CTA, when CFS ADC is offline, INL shall instruct aircraft departing into CTA to report lined up on the runway and issue an airways clearance (traffic pending) at that time.

#### RK CTR
Whilst the **RKA** controller is expected to provide a [top-down service](../../../aerodromes/Rockhampton) to YBRK when **RK ADC** is offline, this is not expected of a KPL controller when both **RKA** and **RK ADC** are offline. If electing not to provide a top-down service to YBRK, the RK CTR Class D is reclassified to Class G `SFC` to `A007`, and Class E `A007` to `A045`.

## Sector Responsibilities

### Sequencing in to YBBN
Aircraft assigned the **same runway** inbound via:  

- BLAKA and GOMOL  
- SMOKA and MORBI

Must be considered to be on the **same STAR** for sequencing purposes. That is, they must be at least **2 minutes **apart at their respective Feeder fixes.

## STAR Clearance Expectation
### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| INL | ARL | YSSY | |
| INL | GOL | YBSU | |
| KPL | BUR | YBBN, YBCG | Non-jets only |
| NSA | KPL | YBRK, YBMK | |
| KPL | KEN(SWY) | YBTL | |

### First Contact
Aircraft being transferred from the following sectors shall be given STAR Clearance on first contact:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| ARL/MNN/MDE | INL, DOS | YBBN, YBCG | |
| KEN(SWY), ISA(CVN) | KPL | YBBN, YBCG | Jets only |
| ISA(CVN) | DOS | YBBN, YBCG | |
| HWE, FLD | SDY | YBBN, YBCG, YBSU | |
| KPL | BUR | YBBN, YBCG | Non-jets only |
| INL | GOL | YBSU | |
| NSA | KPL | YBRK, YBMK | |

## STAR Assignment
### PROPS
When operating a PROPS Runway Mode, Aircraft shall be assigned the appropriate 'ALPHA' STAR (or other STAR on pilot request), with the following runway selection:

| FF | Runway |
| ---- | -------- |
| BLAKA | 01R/19L |
| GOMOL | 01R/19L |
| UGTUG | 01R/**19R** |
| TEBOT | 01R/**19R** |
| MORBI | 01L/19R |
| SMOKA | 01L/19R |
| WOODY | 01L/19R |
| ENLIP | 01L/**19L** |
| Other aircraft: |
| From the NORTH and WEST | 01L/19R |
| From the SOUTH and EAST | 01R/19L |

These standard runway assignments may be modified strategically by the BAS or BFL controller.

!!! example
    If during an event, the vast majority of traffic is coming from **BLAKA** and **GOMOL** feeder fixes, BAS/BFL may elect to assign 19L to **BLAKA** arrivals and 19R to **GOMOL** arrivals, to keep them strategically spearated in the TCU.

    <span class="hotline">**BFL** -> **INL**</span>: "All arrivals via GOMOL to be assigned 19R until further notice"  
    <span class="hotline">**INL** -> **BFL**</span>: "Roger, Arrivals via GOMOL to be assigned 19R" 

### SODPROPS
When operating the SODPROPS Runway Mode, aircraft via **ENLIP**, **BLAKA**, **GOMOL** and **UGTUG**, shall be assigned the **ISPON** STAR with the appropriate transition. Aircraft via other Feeder fixes may be assigned the standard STAR.

## Coordination
### BN TCU
#### Airspace
The Vertical limits of the BN TCU are `SFC` to `F180`, except in BAC airspace, where it is `SFC` to `A075` in the North West, and `SFC` to `F125` in the South East.

Refer to [Brisbane TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/brisbane/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **BAS**, **BDN** and/or **BDS** are online.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBBN** or **YBCG**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A090` for **YBBN** arrivals; or  
- Assigned `F130` for **YBCG** arrivals

Additionally, Voiceless coordination may be used for **YBCG** arrivals tracking via **BN** and assigned `F190`.

All other aircraft coming from INL CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to BN TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for aircraft:

- With ADEP **YBBN**  
    - Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
    - Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`  
- With ADEP **YBCG**  
    - Tracking via **APAGI** and assigned the lower of `F120` or the `RFL`; or  
    - Tracking via **BN** and assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`  
- With ADES **YBSU**  
    - Assigned the **ITIDE** STAR; and  
    - Assigned `F130`
    
All other aircraft going to INL CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by BN TCU.

### Enroute
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

### INL Internal
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that INL(All) give **Heads-up Coordination** to the relevant sector prior to **20nm** from the boundary in the following scenarios:

- INL to DOS for all aircraft  
- DOS to BUR, NSA, GOL and INL for all aircraft  
- SDY to NSA, GOL and INL for all aircraft  

### SU ADC
#### Airspace
SU ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the SU CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#su-ctr) for operations when SU ADC is offline.

#### Departures
Departures from YBSU in to NSA Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**SU ADC** -> **NSA**</span>: "Next, BNZ123"  
    <span class="hotline">**NSA** -> **SU ADC**</span>: "BNZ123, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**SU ADC** -> **NSA**</span>: "BNZ123"

The Standard Assignable level from **SU ADC** to NSA is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
NSA must ensure all YBSU arrivals have been assigned a STAR, unless the pilot is unable to accept one.  
YBSU arrivals shall be coordinated to **SU ADC** from NSA prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**NSA** -> **SU ADC**</span>: "via ITIDE2W Arrival, JST731"  
    <span class="hotline">**SU ADC** -> **NSA**</span>: "JST731"

The Standard Assignable level from NSA to **SU ADC** is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### RKA
#### Airspace
RKA is responsible for the airspace within the 'RK keyhole' `SFC` to `F150`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#rk-ctr) for operations when RKA is offline.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBRK**; and  
- Assigned the **ABVAS** or **DADBO** STAR; and  
- Assigned `A070`

All other aircraft coming from KPL CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to RKA prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via **BUDGI** or **TARES**; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F150` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to KPL CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by RKA.

### CFS ADC
#### Airspace
CFS ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the CFS CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#cfs-ctr) for operations when CFS ADC is offline.

#### Departures
Departures from YCFS in to INL Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.

!!! example 
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **INL**</span>: "Next, BNZ185"  
    <span class="hotline">**INL** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "BNZ185, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **INL**</span>: "BNZ185"  

The Standard Assignable level from **CFS ADC** to INL is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
YCFS arrivals shall be coordinated to **CFS ADC** from INL prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**INL** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "via IDNER, VET"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **INL**</span>: "VET"  

The Standard Assignable level from INL to **CFS ADC** is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### OK TCU / AMB TCU
#### Airspace
By default, **OK TCU** owns the airspace within the **R654A-D** restricted areas, and **AMB TCU** owns the airspace within the **R625A-D** restricted areas, unless stated otherwise by ad-hoc release or NOTAM.

#### Departures
All aircraft from AMB/OK TCU to INL(All) require Heads-up coordination prior to the boundary. Expect this coordination to be completed a short time after the aircraft becomes airborne (pending controller workload).

!!! example 
    <span class="hotline">**AMB TCU** -> **NSA**</span>: "via COWIE, BUCK03."  
    <span class="hotline">**NSA** -> **AMB TCU**</span>: "BUCK03, `F190`"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from INL(All) to **OK TCU** and **AMB TCU** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **OK TCU** and **AMB TCU** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels. ENR and TCU controllers should coordinate to determine the most suitable level.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**GOL** -> **AMB TCU**</span>: "via HUUGO, STAL13, what level can I assign?"  
    <span class="hotline">**AMB TCU** -> **GOL**</span>: "STAL13, `A090`"  
    <span class="hotline">**GOL** -> **AMB TCU**</span>: "`A090`, STAL13"   

### FLD (Oceanic)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.
