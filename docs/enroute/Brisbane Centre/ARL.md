## Airspace
When **TW ADC** is offline, TW CTR (Class D and C `SFC` to `A085`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by ARL and MDE. Alternatively, ARL (not MDE) may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/tamworth) if they wish (not recommended).  

When **CFS ADC** is offline, CFS CTR (Class D `SFC` to `A045`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by MNN and INL. MNN is **not permitted** to provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Coffs), only INL can do this, and they must coordinate with MNN if they are doing so.

## Sector Responsibilities
### Armidale (ARL) / Manning (MNN)
ARL and MNN are responsible for initial sequencing, issuing STAR Clearances, and issuing initial descent for aircraft bound for YSSY, via BOREE and MEPIL respectively. Aircraft cruising above `F250` should be assigned *no lower* than `F250` and handed to CNK for further descent. Aircraft cruising below `F250` should be transferred to CNK at their cruise level.

Refer to the [Sequencing into YSSY](#sequencing-into-yssy) notes below for runway and STAR selection notes.

ARL is also responsible for aircraft operating into/out of YSTW from the south/east when TW ADC is operating.

!!! note
    ARL and MDE share a joint responsibility to build the final sequence of arrivals into YSTW when the tower is open. Coordination with MDE should be conducted to ensure that aircraft from each sector are sequenced appropriately with each other.

### Cessnock (CNK) 
CNK is responsible for final sequencing and descent for aircraft bound for YSSY, via BOREE and MEPIL.

Refer to the [Sequencing into YSSY](#sequencing-into-yssy) notes below for runway and STAR selection notes.

### Maitland (MLD)
MLD is responsible for handling northbound departures from YSSY and arrivals into YWLM from the south.

### Mudgee (MDE)
MDE is responsible for aircraft operating into/out of YSTW from the north/west when TW ADC is operating.

!!! note
    ARL and MDE share a joint responsibility to build the final sequence of arrivals into YSTW when the tower is open. Coordination with ARL should be conducted to ensure that aircraft from each sector are sequenced appropriately with each other.

### Ocean (OCN)
OCN is responsible for sequencing, issuing STAR Clearances, and issuing descent for aircraft bound for YSSY via MARLN.

Refer to the [Sequencing into YSSY](#sequencing-into-yssy) notes below for runway selection notes.

### Sequencing into YSSY
Sequencing arrivals from the north/east into YSSY is a joint responsibility of the subsectors of ARL. Initial sequencing actions for aircraft from the north should be performed by ARL and MNN, with fine tuning and any holding required issued by CNK. 

Aircraft from the north/east shall be assigned **runway 16L/34R** during PROPS. However, some situations may warrant the use of the main runway (16R/34L), such as heavy aircraft operationally requiring the longer runway or large volumes of traffic requiring the use of both runways to minimise delay. In this case, coordination must be conducted with Melbourne Centre or Sydney Flow (if operating) to ensure that the sequence is built in an efficient and orderly way.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **BIK**</span>: "North of Sydney, CPA21, with your concurrence will be assigned runway 34L due operational requirement"  
    <span class="hotline">**BIK** -> **ARL**</span>: "Concur, CPA21 runway 34L, required landing time 43 due sequence from the west"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **BIK**</span>: "Runway 34L, landing time 43, CPA21"

Jet aircraft for YSSY shall be assigned the **BOREE** STAR.  
Non-jet aircraft for YSSY shall be assigned the **MEPIL** STAR.

!!! tip
    Whilst the preference is to keep jet/non-jet aircraft assigned the default STAR as above, there are situations where the sequence may be improved by assigning the adjacent STAR (e.g. a jet assigned the MEPIL STAR). This is most common when assigning the alternate runway to an arrival.  
    
    Either **SY TCU** or **ARL** may propose utilising the adjacent STAR where two aircraft with significantly different cruise/descent speeds will be required to overtake or pass abeam each other to achieve a sequenced landing time, or if assigned different runways. This technique can allow aircraft to be processed for different runways independently with minimal delay by using the built-in separation afforded by the STAR height requirements.  

    In this case, coordination should be conducted to ensure that both controllers agree and no additional conflicts are created as a result (particularly with aircraft inbound from the south/west).

!!! example
    **BIK:** "RXA6417, amended tracking and STAR available"  
    **RXA6417:** "RXA6417, go ahead"  
    **BIK:** "RXA6417, recleared direct BOREE for the BOREE3A arrival, runway 34L, maintain FL180"  
    **RXA6417:** "Recleared direct BOREE for the BOREE3A arrival, runway 34L, maintain FL180, RXA6417"

## STAR Clearance Expectation
### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| MNN | INL | YBBN, YBCG | |
| MDE | YWE(KAT) | YSCB | |
| MNN | ARL | YSSY | |

### First Contact
Aircraft being transferred from the following sectors shall be given STAR Clearance on first contact:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| INL, MNN | ARL | YSSY | |
| TSN/HWE | OCN | YSSY | |

## Coordination
### SY TCU
The Standard Assignable level from ARL(All) to SY TCU is:  
`A100` for aircraft tracking via BOREE or MARLN, and assigned the relevant STAR  
`A090` for aircraft tracking via MEPIL, and assigned the MEPIL STAR  

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to SY TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from SY TCU to ARL(All) is the lower of `F280` or the `RFL`, and tracking via a SID terminus.

Refer to [Sydney TCU Airspace Division](../../terminal/sydney/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **SAS**, **SDN**, **SDS** and/or **SRI** are online.

### Enroute
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

### ARL Internal
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

That being said, due to their small sizes and frequent random-track traffic, it is *advised* that ARL(All) gives **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:   
- MNN to ARL for all aircraft  
- ARL to MNN for all aircraft  
- CNK to MLD for all aircraft  
- MLD to CNK for all aircraft

### TW ADC
#### Airspace
When **TW ADC** is online, **ARL** owns the Class C airspace from `A065` upwards. **TW ADC** owns the Class D airspace `SFC` to `A045` and Class C airspace `A045` to `A065`.

When **TW ADC** is closed, the Class C airspace `A085` and below is reclassified Class G.

#### Departures
Departures from YSTW in to ARL/MDE Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **MDE**</span>: "Next, SKV"  
    <span class="hotline">**MDE** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "SKV, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **MDE**</span>: "SKV"  

The Standard Assignable level from **TW ADC** to ARL/MDE is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
YSTW arrivals shall be heads-up coordinated to **TW ADC** from ARL/MDE prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "QLK6D, via MATLA DCT STWWD"  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "QLK6D"  

The Standard Assignable level from ARL/MDE to **TW ADC** is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### CFS ADC
#### Airspace
**INL** and **MNN** own the Class C airspace from **A045** upwards, and **CFS ADC** (when online) owns the Class D airspace **SFC-A045**.

#### Departures
Departures from YCFS in to MNN Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "Next, CFH21"  
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "CFH21, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "CFH21"  

The Standard Assignable level from **CFS ADC** to MNN is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
YCFS arrivals shall be heads-up coordinated to **CFS ADC** from MNN prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "Via KADSI, RXA6438"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "RXA6438"  

The Standard Assignable level from MNN to **CFS ADC** is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

#### Overfliers
Any aircraft that will enter CFS ADC airspace, and not landing at YCFS, must be Heads-up coordinated prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "via CFS, GNP, Overflier"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "GNP, A030"

### WLM TCU
#### Airspace
By default, **WLM TCU** (when online) owns the airspace within the **R578A-G** restricted areas, unless stated otherwise by ad-hoc release or NOTAM. It is the responsibility of the **WLM TCU** controller to inform ARL(All) of what airspace they are assuming.

When WLM TCU is offline, **ARL** administers the Class E airspace (generally **A085** and above, or **A045** and above in some airspace steps) and the military Class C airspace is reclassified as Class G.

#### Departures
Departures from **WLM TCU** in to ARL(All) Class C will be heads-up coordinated.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **MNN**</span>: "Departed YWLM, WGTL33, will be assigned F120"  
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "WGTL33, F120"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from ARL(All) to **WLM TCU** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **WLM TCU** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the ARL(All) and **WLM TCU** controller agree on.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "via SANAD, JST458, will be assigned F130"  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **MNN**</span>: "JST458, F130"  

!!! tip
    To keep it simple and safe, coordinate departures at the Lowest Assignable level over the TCU (eg, with standard WLM TCU configuration, `F130`). You may coordinate other levels with WLM TCU if required for separation purposes.

#### R574 Release
To put it bluntly, the R574 Restricted Area is quite large.

<figure markdown>
![R574 Restricted Area](../../military/img/r574.png){ width="700" }
  <figcaption>R574 Restricted Area</figcaption>
</figure>

It also occupies a lot of airspace that would commonly be used by YSSY arrivals and departures. If YWLM military operations are taking ownership of this airspace, it is good practice to negotiate an airspace release, whether that be a lateral or vertical portion of airspace (or a combination), to enable them to facilitate YSSY arrivals and departures with minimal impact.

### TSN/HWE (Oceanic)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-oceanic), Heads-up coordinate prior to **15 mins** to boundary.
