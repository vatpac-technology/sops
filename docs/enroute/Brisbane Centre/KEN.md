## Airspace
KEN is responsible for **BAR**, **TBP**, and **SWY** when they are offline.  
SWY is responsible for the [MK TCU](../../../terminal/coral) when **MKA** is offline.  
BAR is responsible for the [CS TCU](../../../terminal/cairns) when **CS TCU** is offline.  

When **TL TCU** is offline, TL CTR (Class C `SFC` to `A085`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by TBP. Alternatively, TBP may provide a [top-down approach service](../../../military/townsville) if they wish.  
When **HM ADC** is offline, HM CTR (Class D `SFC` to `A045`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by SWY. Alternatively, SWY may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Hammo) if they wish (not recommended).  

Whilst the **MKA** controller is expected to provide a [top-down service](../../../aerodromes/Mackay) to YBMK when **MK ADC** is offline, this is not expected of a SWY controller when both **MKA** and **MK ADC** are offline. If electing not to provide a top-down service to YBMK, the RK CTR Class D is reclassified to Class G `SFC` to `A007`, and Class E `A007` to `A045`.

## Sector Responsibilities
All Subsectors are responsible for issuing STAR Clearances for YBMK, YBTL and YBCS on first contact.
## Coordination
### KEN/BAR / CS TCU
The Standard Assignable level from KEN/BAR to CS TCU is `A070` and assigned the relevant STAR. 

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to CS TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from CS TCU to KEN/BAR is the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`

Refer to [Cairns TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/cairns/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **CS TCU** is online.

### TBP / TL TCU
Reserved.

### KPL / MK TCU
The Standard assignable level from SWY to **MK TCU** is `A070`, and assigned the DAGSI STAR or WELKE STAR.

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to **MK TCU** prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from **MK TCU** to KPL is `F150`, and tracking via CLIFT or POONA.
#### Airspace
When **MK TCU** is online, they own up to `F150` in the **shaded** are shown below:

### KEN (All) / ENR

As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

### KEN/BAR/TBP/SWY Internal

As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

TBP may make changes to CFL up to the boundary with KEN for the purposes of issuing descent for YBCS.

### SWY / HM ADC
#### Departures
Departures from YBHM in to SWY Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.  

!!! example
    **HM ADC** -> **SWY**: "Next, QFA797"  
    **SWY** -> **HM ADC**: "QFA797"  

The Standard Assignable level from HM ADC to SWY is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
#### Arrivals
SWY must coordinate the sequence to HM ADC prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    **SWY** -> **HM ADC**: "New Sequence of 2. Via OPOSI for RNP U RWY 32, JST848, Number 1. Via SWIFT, UTY551, Number 2”  
    **HM ADC** -> **SWY**: "JST848, Number 1. UTY551, Number 2"  

The Standard Assignable level from KEN(SWY) to HM ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### TBP/SWY / TSN(FLD) (Oceanic)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-oceanic), Voice coordinate estimate and level prior to **15 mins** to boundary.
