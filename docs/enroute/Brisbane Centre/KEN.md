### CPDLC

The Primary Communication Method for KEN is Voice.

[CPDLC](../../../client/cpdlc) may be used in lieu when applicable.

The CPDLC Station Code is `YKEN`.

!!! tip
        Even though KEN's Primary Communication Method is Voice, CPDLC may be used for Overfliers.

## Airspace

</figure>

KEN is responsible for **BAR**, **TBP**, and **SWY** when they are offline.  
SWY is responsible for the [MK TCU](../../../terminal/coral) when **MKA** is offline.  
BAR is responsible for the [CS TCU](../../../terminal/cairns) when **CS TCU** is offline.  

### Reclassifications
#### TL CTR
When **TL TCU** is offline, TL CTR (Class C `SFC` to `A085`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by TBP. Alternatively, TBP may provide a [top-down approach service](../../../military/townsville) if they wish.

#### HM CTR
When **HM ADC** is offline, HM CTR (Class D `SFC` to `A045`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by SWY. Alternatively, SWY may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Hammo) if they wish (not recommended).  

#### MK CTR
Whilst the **MKA** controller is expected to provide a [top-down service](../../../aerodromes/Mackay) to YBMK when **MK ADC** is offline, this is not expected of a SWY controller when both **MKA** and **MK ADC** are offline. If electing not to provide a top-down service to YBMK, the RK CTR Class D is reclassified to Class G `SFC` to `A007`, and Class E `A007` to `A045`.

## Sector Responsibilities
All Subsectors are responsible for issuing STAR Clearances for YBMK, YBTL and YBCS on first contact.

## STAR Clearance Expectation
### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| TBP | SWY | YBRK | |
| KEN | TBP | YBMK | |
| SWY | TBP | YBCS | |
| BAR | KEN | YBTL | |
| SWY | INL(KPL) | YBBN, YBCG | Jets only |
| SWY | INL(KPL) | YBSU | |

### First Contact
Aircraft being transferred from the following sectors shall be given STAR Clearance on first contact:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| INL(KPL) | SWY | YBTL | |
| ISA | TBP | YBTL | |
| ARA/ISA | BAR, KEN | YBCS | |
| TBP | SWY | YBRK | |
| KEN | TBP | YBMK | |
| SWY | TBP | YBCS | |
| BAR | KEN | YBTL | |

## Coordination
### CS TCU
#### Airspace
The Vertical limits of the CS TCU are `SFC` to `F180`.  

Refer to [Cairns TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/cairns/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **CS2** is online.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBCS**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned the Standard Assignable level of:  
  - Radials 055° clockwise through to 355°: `A070`  
  - Radials 355° clockwise to 055°: `A090`

All other aircraft coming from KEN CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to CS TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to KEN CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by CS TCU.

### TL TCU
#### Airspace
TL TCU owns the Class C and G airspace within 36 DME TL from `SFC` to `F180`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#tl-ctr) for operations when TL TCU is offline.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBTL**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A100`

All other aircraft coming from TBP CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to TL TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to TBP CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by TL TCU.

### MKA
#### Airspace
MKA is responsible for the airspace within the 'MK keyhole' `SFC` to `F150`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#mk-ctr) for operations when MKA is offline.

#### Arrivals
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBMK**; and  
- Assigned the **DAGSI** or **WELKE** STAR; and  
- Assigned `A070`

All other aircraft coming from SWY CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to MKA prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via **CLIFT** or **MUNAR**; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F150` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to SWY CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by MKA.

#### Airspace
When **MKA** is online, they own up to `F150` in the **shaded** are shown below:

### Enroute
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

### KEN Internal
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

TBP may make changes to CFL up to the boundary with KEN for the purposes of issuing descent for YBCS.

### HM ADC
#### Airspace
HM ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the HM CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#hm-ctr) for operations when HM ADC is offline.

#### Departures
Departures from YBHM in to SWY Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.  

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**HM ADC** -> **SWY**</span>: "Next, QFA797"  
    <span class="hotline">**SWY** -> **HM ADC**</span>: "QFA797, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**HM ADC** -> **SWY**</span>: "QFA797"  

The Standard Assignable level from HM ADC to SWY is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
#### Arrivals
YBHM arrivals shall be heads-up coordinated to **JM ADC** from SWY prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**SWY** -> **HM ADC**</span>: "Via OPOSI for RNP U RWY 32, JST848”  
    <span class="hotline">**HM ADC** -> **SWY**</span>: "JST848, RNP U RWY 32"  

The Standard Assignable level from KEN(SWY) to HM ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### FLD (Oceanic)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.
