## BIK/WOL / SY TCU
### Standard Assignable Levels
The Standard assignable level from BIK to SY TCU is:  
`A100` for aircraft tracking via RIVET, and assigned the RIVET # STAR  
`A090` for aircraft tracking via ODALE, and assigned the ODALE # STAR  

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to SY TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

## WOL/GUN / CB TCU
### Standard Assignable Levels

The Standard assignable level from WOL to CB TCU is `F130`, and assigned the RAZZI #, BUNGO #, or AVBEG # STAR. //F120 as per IRL?    

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to CB TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

!!! note
    These coordination requirements apply to aircraft entering the CB TCU, even if the airspace is owned by ELW/BLA

## BIK (All) / ENR

As per the enroute coordination requirements (link), voiceless coordination exists between enroute sectors, with no changes within 20nm to the boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that BIK give **Heads-up Coordination** to the relevant sector, prior to **20nm** from the boundary, for **any aircraft not on the Q29 or V169 airways**. 

## WOL / TSN (Oceanic)

As per Standard coordination procedures (link).

## WOL / NW APP
#### Departures
Departures from YSNW in to WOL Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and will be requesting a level.

!!! example
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "Taxi, PSDN18 for YMCO via URBOB, Requesting F130"  
    **WOL** -> **NW APP**: "PSDN18, F130"  
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "F130, PSDN18"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from WOL to **NW APP** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **NW APP** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the WOL and **NW APP** controller agree on.

!!! example
    **WOL** -> **NW APP**: "via CB, SKJ, with your concurrence, will be assigned descent to A090"  
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "SKJ, concur A090"
