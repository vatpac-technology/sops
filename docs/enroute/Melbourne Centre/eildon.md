## Airspace

ELW is responsible for the ML TCU when **ML APP** is offline.  
ELW is responsible for **BLA** and **SNO** when they are offline.  
BLA may elect to, at their discretion, provide a top-down approach service for CB TCU when **CB APP** is offline. BLA may also elect to reclassify the Class C airspace within the CB TCU to Class G up to **A085** when **CB APP** is offline.

AY CTR (Class D and C SFC-A085) reverts to Class G when **AY TWR** is offline, and is administered by BLA.

## Sector Responsibilities
### Eildon Weir (ELW)
ELW is responsible for the final "finessing" of the sequence for aircraft in to the ML TCU.

### Benalla (BLA)
BLA is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and descent for aircraft bound for YMML, YMAV, and YSCB.

### Snowy (SNO)
SNO is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and descent for aircraft bound for YSCB.
## Coordination
### ELW / ML TCU
#### Standard Assignable Levels
The Standard assignable level from ELW to ML TCU is `A090` and assigned a STAR.

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to ML TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

### BLA / CB TCU
#### Standard Assignable Levels

The Standard assignable level from BLA to CB TCU is `F120`, and assigned the POLLI # or MANDA # STAR.  

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to CB TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

### ELW (All) / ENR

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW give **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- BLA to BIK(GUN) for aircraft **not** on the Y59 or W817 airway  
- ELW to YWE and WON for all aircraft  
- BLA to YWE(All) and BIK(WOL) for all aircraft  
- SNO to BIK(WOL) for all aircraft

### ELW/BLA/SNO Internal

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW/BLA/SNO give **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- ELW to BLA for aircraft **not** on the Y59, H66, or W569 airway  
- BLA to ELW for aircraft **not** on the Q29 or V169 airway  
- SNO to BLA for all aircraft

### SNO / TSN (Oceanic)

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voice coordinate estimate and level prior to **15 mins** to boundary.

### ELW(All) / ESL APP
#### Airspace
By default, **ESL APP** owns the airspace within 30nm ESL, SFC-F200, unless stated otherwise by ad-hoc release or NOTAM.
#### Departures
Departures from YMES in to ELW(All) Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and will be requesting a level.

!!! example
    **ESL APP** -> **SNO**: "Taxi, ALDN14 for YSWG via VALDU, Requesting F210"  
    **SNO** -> **ESL APP**: "ALDN14, F210"  
    **ESL APP** -> **SNO**: "F210, ALDN14"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from ELW(All) to **ESL APP** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **ESL APP** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the ELW(All) and **ESL APP** controller agree on.

!!! example
    **ELW** -> **ESL APP**: "via MNG, BFRT21, will be assigned F220, BLA and myself have no restrictions on descent"  
    **ESL APP** -> **ELW**: "BFRT21, F220"  

### BLA / AY TWR
#### Airspace
**AY TWR** own the Class D airspace up to A045. BLA own the Class C steps in the "AY keyhole" between A045-A085.
#### Departures
Departures from YMAY in to BLA Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and ready for departure. BLA will coordinate a level at the "Next" call.

!!! example
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "Taxi, RXA6772 for YSSY via UGVER1 departure"  
    **BLA** -> **AY TWR**: "RRXA6772"  
    ...  
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "Next, RXA6772"  
    **BLA** -> **AY TWR**: "RXA6772, A050"  
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "A050, RXA6772"  

#### Arrivals
YMAY arrivals shall be coordinated to **AY TWR** from BLA prior to transfer of jurisdiction.

!!! example
    **BLA** -> **AY TWR**: "QLK38, via VEGRU1 arrival, Number 1"  
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "QLK38, Number 1"
