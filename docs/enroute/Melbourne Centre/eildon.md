## Airspace

ELW is responsible for the ML TCU when **ML APP** is offline.  
ELW is responsible for **BLA** and **SNO** when they are offline.  
BLA may elect to, at their discretion, provide a top-down approach service for CB TCU when **CB APP** is offline. BLA may also elect to reclassify the Class C airspace within the CB TCU to Class G up to **A085** when **CB APP** is offline.

AY CTR (Class D and C SFC-A085) reverts to Class G when **AY TWR** is offline, and is administered by BLA.

## Sector Responsibilities
### Eildon Weir (ELW)
ELW is responsible for the final finessing of the sequence in for aircraft in to the ML TCU.

### Benalla (BLA)
BLA is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and descent for aircraft bound for YMML, YMAV, and YSCB.

### Snowy (SNO)
SNO is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and descent for aircraft bound for YSCB.
## Coordination
### ELW / ML TCU
#### Standard Assignable Levels
The Standard assignable level from ELW to ML TCU is `A090` and assigned a STAR.

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to ML TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

### BLA / CB TCU
#### Standard Assignable Levels

The Standard assignable level from BLA to CB TCU is `F120`, and assigned the POLLI # or MANDA # STAR.  

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to CB TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

### ELW (All) / ENR

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW give **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- BLA to BIK(GUN) for aircraft **not** on the Y59 or W817 airway  
- ELW to YWE and WON for all aircraft  
- BLA to YWE(All) and BIK(WOL) for all aircraft  
- SNO to BIK(WOL) for all aircraft

### ELW/BLA/SNO Internal

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW/BLA/SNO give **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- ELW to BLA for aircraft **not** on the Y59, H66, or W569 airway  
- BLA to ELW for aircraft **not** on the Q29 or V169 airway  
- SNO to BLA for all aircraft

### SNO / TSN (Oceanic)

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voice coordinate estimate and level prior to **15 mins** to boundary.

### BLA/SNO / ESL APP
#### Departures
Departures from YSNW in to WOL Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and will be requesting a level.

!!! example
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "Taxi, PSDN18 for YMCO via URBOB, Requesting F130"  
    **WOL** -> **NW APP**: "PSDN18, F130"  
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "F130, PSDN18"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from WOL to **NW APP** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **NW APP** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the WOL and **NW APP** controller agree on.

!!! example
    **WOL** -> **NW APP**: "via CB, SKJ, with your concurrence, will be assigned descent to A090"  
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "SKJ, concur A090"  

### BLA / AY TWR
#### Departures
Departures from YMAY in to BLA Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and will be requesting a level.

!!! example
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "Taxi, PSDN18 for YMCO via URBOB, Requesting F130"  
    **WOL** -> **NW APP**: "PSDN18, F130"  
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "F130, PSDN18"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from WOL to **NW APP** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **NW APP** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the WOL and **NW APP** controller agree on.

!!! example
    **WOL** -> **NW APP**: "via CB, SKJ, with your concurrence, will be assigned descent to A090"  
    **NW APP** -> **WOL**: "SKJ, concur A090"
