## Airspace

ELW is responsible for the ML TCU when **ML APP** is offline.  
ELW is responsible for **BLA** and **SNO** when they are offline.  

When **CB APP** is offline, CB TCU (Class C SFC-F245) reverts to Class G, and is administered by BLA. Alternatively, BLA may provide a top-down approach service if they wish.  
When **AY TWR** is offline, AY CTR (Class D and C SFC-A085) reverts to Class G, and is administered by BLA. Alternatively, BLA may provide a top-down procedural service if they wish.

## Sector Responsibilities
### Eildon Weir (ELW)
ELW is responsible for the final sequencing actions in to YMML.
### Benalla (BLA)
BLA is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and initial descent for aircraft bound for YMML, YMAV, and YSCB. BLA is also responsible for sequencing in to YSCB, and initial sequencing in to YMML.
### Snowy (SNO)
SNO is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and initial descent for aircraft bound for YSCB.
## Coordination
### BLA / CB TCU

The Standard assignable level from BLA to CB TCU is `F120`, and assigned the POLLI # or MANDA # STAR.  

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to CB TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from CB TCU to BLA is the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`, and tracking via HOWLY, WG, NONUP, TANTA, or DUBUS.

### ELW / ML TCU

The Standard assignable level from ELW to CML TCU is `A090`, and assigned the LIZZI # or BOYSE # STAR.  

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to ML TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from ML TCU to ELW is the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`, and tracking via MNG, NONIX, or DOSEL.

Refer to [Melbourne TCU Airspace Division](http://sops.vatpac.org/terminal/Melbourne%20TCU/operations/#airspace-division){target=new} for information on airspace divisions when **MDN** and/or **MDS** are online.
### ELW (All) / ENR

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW give **Heads-up Coordination** prior to **20nm** from the boundary in the following scenarios:  
- BLA to BIK(GUN) for aircraft **not** on the Y59 or W817 airway*  
- ELW to YWE and WON for all aircraft  
- BLA to YWE(All) and BIK(WOL) for all aircraft  
- SNO to BIK(WOL) for all aircraft

!!! tip
    **BLA** should aim to handoff aircraft as soon as possible to **GUN**, so they can issue STAR clearance and commence sequencing. Remember, As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/#handoffs){target=new}, the Receiving sector may turn the aircraft 45° left or right and climb/descend to any level. So if required, nominate a restriction.

### ELW/BLA/SNO Internal

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW/BLA/SNO give **Heads-up Coordination** prior to **20nm** from the boundary in the following scenarios:  
- ELW to BLA for aircraft **not** on the Y59, H66, or W569 airway (Changes permitted up to boundary for sequencing/descent purposes)  
- BLA to ELW for aircraft **not** on the Q29 or V169 airway (Changes permitted up to boundary for sequencing/descent purposes)  
- SNO to BLA for all aircraft

### SNO / TSN (Oceanic)

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/#enr-oceanic){target=new}, Voice coordinate estimate and level prior to **15 mins** to boundary.

### ELW(All) / ESL APP
#### Airspace
By default, **ESL APP** owns the airspace within 30nm ESL, SFC-F200, unless stated otherwise by ad-hoc release or NOTAM.
#### Departures
Departures from YMES in to ELW(All) Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and will be requesting a level.

!!! example
    **ESL APP** -> **SNO**: "Taxi, ALDN14 for YSWG via VALDU, Requesting F210"  
    **SNO** -> **ESL APP**: "ALDN14, F210"  
    **ESL APP** -> **SNO**: "F210, ALDN14"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from ELW(All) to **ESL APP** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **ESL APP** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the ELW(All) and **ESL APP** controller agree on.

!!! example
    **ELW** -> **ESL APP**: "via MNG, BFRT21, will be assigned F220, BLA and myself have no restrictions on descent"  
    **ESL APP** -> **ELW**: "BFRT21, F220"  

### BLA / AY TWR
#### Airspace
**AY TWR** own the Class D airspace up to A045. BLA own the Class C steps in the "AY keyhole" between A045-A085.
#### Departures
Departures from YMAY in to BLA Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and ready for departure. BLA will coordinate a level at the "Next" call.

!!! example
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "Taxi, RXA6772 for YSSY via UGVER1 departure"  
    **BLA** -> **AY TWR**: "RXA6772"  
    ...  
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "Next, RXA6772"  
    **BLA** -> **AY TWR**: "RXA6772, A050"  
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "A050, RXA6772"  

The Standard Assignable level from **AY TWR** to BLA is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
The Standard Assignable level from BLA to **AY TWR** is `A080`. Any aircraft that will not be assigned the Standard Assignable level must have that level concurred by **AY TWR**.
YMAY arrivals shall be coordinated to **AY TWR** from BLA prior to transfer of jurisdiction.

!!! example
    **BLA** -> **AY TWR**: "QLK38, via VEGRU1 arrival, Number 1"  
    **AY TWR** -> **BLA**: "QLK38, Number 1"  

!!! caution
    It is the responsibility of **AY TWR** to manage the sequence in to YMAY. This can be challenging, as it involves transitioning from **Radar** standards to **Procedural** standards. BLA can greatly assist with this however, with use of Radar/ADSB tools, getting coordination done early, and ensuring any aircraft within **10 minutes** arrival time at YMAY, are assigned a *vertically separated level* at handoff to **AY TWR**. For example:  
    **QLK123D** ETA AY 0239, Number 1, A080  
    **RXA4567** ETA AY 0244, Number 2, A090  
    **FD321** ETA AY 0246, Number 3, A100
