† *Non-standard positions* may only be used in accordance with [VATPAC Air Traffic Services Policy](https://vatpac.org/publications/policies){target=new}

### CPDLC

The Primary Communication Method for ELW is Voice.

[CPDLC](../../../client/cpdlc) may be used in lieu when applicable.

The CPDLC Station Code is `YELW`.

!!! tip
        Even though ELW's Primary Communication Method is Voice, CPDLC may be used for Overfliers.

### Reclassifications
#### CB CTR
When **CB TCU** is offline, CB TCU (Class C `SFC` to `A085`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by BLA. Alternatively, BLA may provide a [top-down approach service](../../../terminal/canberra) if they wish.

#### AY CTR
When **AY ADC** is offline, AY CTR (Class D and C `SFC` to `A085`) reverts to Class G, and is administered by BLA. Alternatively, BLA may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Albury) if they wish.

## Sector Responsibilities
### Eildon Weir (ELW)
ELW is responsible for the final sequencing actions in to YMML, and issuing STAR clearances to Non-jets bound for YMML and YMAV.
### Benalla (BLA)
BLA is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and initial descent for aircraft bound for YMML (Jets only), YMAV (Jets only), and YSCB. BLA is also responsible for sequencing in to YSCB, and initial sequencing in to YMML.

#### YSCB STARs
When Runway 35 is in use at YSCB, by default, vatSys will select the POLLI STAR with the **ARRAN** transition. Aircraft that have planned via EBONY and ARRAN (ie, aircraft on the Y59 airway) need to be assigned the POLLI STAR with the **EBONY** transition. This can be manually overridden in the aircraft's flight plan as shown below:

### Snowy (SNO)
SNO is reponsible for issuing STAR clearances and initial descent for aircraft bound for YSCB.

## STAR Clearance Expectation
### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| BLA | BIK(GUN) | YSSY | |
| ELW | BLA | YSCB | |
| SNO | HUO | YMHB | |
| BLA | ELW | YMML | Non-Jets only |
| SNO | YWE(WON) | YMML | |

### First Contact
Aircraft being transferred from the following sectors shall be given STAR Clearance on first contact:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| YWE(OXL,GTH) | BLA | YSCB | |
| BIK(WOL) | BLA | YMML, YMAV | Jets Only |
| ELW | BLA | YSCB | |
| BLA | ELW | YMML | Non-Jets only |

## Coordination
### CB TCU
#### Airspace
The Vertical limits of the CB TCU are `SFC` to `F245`.

Refer to [Canberra TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/canberra/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **CBW** is online.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#cb-ctr) for operations when CB TCU is offline.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YSCB**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `F130`

All other aircraft coming from BLA CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to CB TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:
 
- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to BLA CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by CB TCU.

### ML TCU
#### Airspace
The Vertical limits of the ML TCU are `SFC` to `F245`.

Refer to [Melbourne TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/melbourne/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **MDN** and/or **MDS** are online.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YMML**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A090`

All other aircraft coming from ELW CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to ML TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via **MNG**, **NONIX**, or **DOSEL**; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to ELW CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by ML TCU.

### Enroute
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW give **Heads-up Coordination** prior to **50nm** from the boundary in the following scenarios:  
- BLA to BIK(GUN) for aircraft **not** on the Y59 or W817 airway*  
- ELW to YWE and WON for all aircraft  
- BLA to YWE(All) and BIK(WOL) for all aircraft  
- SNO to BIK(WOL) for all aircraft

!!! tip
    **BLA** should aim to handoff aircraft as soon as possible to **GUN**, so they can issue STAR clearance and commence sequencing. Remember, As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#handoffs), the Receiving sector may turn the aircraft 45° left or right and climb/descend to any level. So if required, nominate a restriction.

### ELW Internal
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that ELW/BLA/SNO give **Heads-up Coordination** prior to **20nm** from the boundary in the following scenarios:  
- ELW to BLA for aircraft **not** on the Y59, H66, or W569 airway (Changes permitted up to boundary for sequencing/descent purposes)  
- BLA to ELW for aircraft **not** on the Q29 or V169 airway (Changes permitted up to boundary for sequencing/descent purposes)  
- SNO to BLA for all aircraft

### ES TCU
Reserved.

### AY ADC
#### Airspace
AY ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the AY CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Reclassifications](#ay-ctr) for operations when AY ADC is offline.

#### Departures
Departures from YMAY in to BLA Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "Next, RXA6772"  
    <span class="hotline">**BLA** -> **AY ADC**</span>: "RXA6772, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "RXA6772"  

The Standard Assignable level from **AY ADC** to BLA is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
YMAY arrivals shall be heads-up coordinated to **AY ADC** from BLA prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BLA** -> **AY ADC**</span>: "via VEGRU1 arrival, QLK38"  
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "QLK38, VEGRU1 arrival" 

The Standard Assignable level from BLA to **AY ADC** is `A080`.

### TSN (Oceanic)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.
