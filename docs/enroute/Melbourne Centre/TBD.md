## Sector Responsibilities
TBD and AUG are responsible for Sequencing, issuing STAR Clearances, and issuing descent for aircraft bound for YPAD and YPED.

### YPAD STARs
Aircraft tracking via OJJAY and MARGO (ie *J251 WHA H84 MARGO*) from the North for Runway 23 shall be assigned:  
**RAYNA** STAR with the **OJJAY** transition  
**not**  
**SALTY** STAR with the **MARGO** transition

vatSys will not necessarily select the correct STAR by default when entering the runway, so ensure the correct STAR is selected.

## STAR Clearance Expectation
### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| TBD | YWE(MUN) | YMML, YMAV | |

### First Contact
Aircraft being transferred from the following sectors shall be given STAR Clearance on first contact:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| YWE(MUN), ASP(BKE) | TBD | YPAD, YPED| |
| ASP(All) | AUG | YPAD, YPED| Jets only |

## Coordination

### AD TCU
The Standard assignable level from TBD/AUG to AD TCU is `A090`, and assigned a STAR.

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to AD TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from AD TCU to TBD/AUG is the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`, and tracking via a SID terminus.

### Enroute
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

### TBD Internal
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.
