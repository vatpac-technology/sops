## Sector Responsibilities
TBD and AUG are responsible for Sequencing, issuing STAR Clearances, and issuing descent for aircraft bound for YPAD and YPED.

**RAYNA** STAR with the **OJJAY** transition  
**not**  
**SALTY** STAR with the **MARGO** transition

vatSys will not necessarily select the correct STAR by default when entering the runway, so ensure the correct STAR is selected.
