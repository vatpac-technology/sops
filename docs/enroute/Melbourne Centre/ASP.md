## Airspace
**AS ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace `SFC` to `A045`, as well as the Class C airspace `A045` to `A065`, within the AS CTR.

When **AS ADC** is offline, AS CTR (Class D and C `SFC` to `F125`) within 80 DME AS reverts to Class G, and AS CTR (Class C `F125` to `F245`) within 80 DME AS reverts to Class E, and both are administered by ASP. Alternatively, ASP may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Alice) if they wish.
