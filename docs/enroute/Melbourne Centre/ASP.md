## Airspace
**AS ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace `SFC` to `A045`, as well as the Class C airspace `A045` to `A065`, within the AS CTR.

When **AS ADC** is offline, AS CTR (Class D and C `SFC` to `F125`) within 80 DME AS reverts to Class G, and AS CTR (Class C `F125` to `F245`) within 80 DME AS reverts to Class E, and both are administered by ASP. Alternatively, ASP may provide a [top-down procedural service](../../../aerodromes/Alice) if they wish.

## STAR Clearance Expectation
### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| FOR, WRA, BKE | TBD(AUG) | YPAD, YPED | Jets only |
| BKE | TBD | YPAD, YPED | |
| ESP | PIY(HYD) | YPPH, YPEA | Jets only |
| BKE | YWE(KAT) | YSSY | |

## Coordination
### Enroute
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **50nm** to boundary.

### ASP Internal

### AS ADC
#### Departures
Departures from YBAS in to ASP Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**AS ADC** -> **ASP**</span>: "Next, QFA797"  
    <span class="hotline">**ASP** -> **AS ADC**</span>: "QFA797, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**AS ADC** -> **ASP**</span>: "Unrestricted, QFA797"  

The Standard Assignable level from **AS ADC** to ASP is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
#### Arrivals
YBAS arrivals shall be heads-up coordinated to **AS ADC** from ASP prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**ASP** -> **AS ADC**</span>: "Via SADEL, QFA1956”  
    <span class="hotline">**AS ADC** -> **ASP**</span>: "QFA1956"  

The Standard Assignable level from ASP to **AS ADC** is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

#### Overfliers
Any aircraft that will enter AS ADC airspace, and not landing at YBAS, must be Heads-up coordinated prior to **5 mins** from the boundary.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**ASP** -> **AS ADC**</span>: "via AS, JDS"  
    <span class="hotline">**AS ADC** -> **ASP**</span>: "JDS, A060"

### IND(INS) (Oceanic)
As per [Standard Coordination Procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-oceanic), Heads-up coordinate prior to **15 mins** to boundary.
