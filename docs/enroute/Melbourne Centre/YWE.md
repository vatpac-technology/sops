## Coordination

### YWE/WON / ML TCU
#### Standard Assignable Levels

The Standard assignable level from YWE and WON to ML TCU is `A090`, and assigned the ARBEY #, PORTS #, WAREN #, or WENDY # STAR.

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to ML TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

### YWE (All) / ENR

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that YWE(All) gives **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- YWE to ELW/BLA for all aircraft  
- WON to ELW/BLA for all aircraft  
- GTH to BLA for all aircraft  
- GTH to BIK/GUN for aircraft **not** planned via TARAL 
- KAT to BIK/GUN for all aircraft  
- MUN to TBD for aircraft **not** on H345 airway  

### YWE/WON/MUN/OXL/GTH/KAT Internal

As per [Standard coordination procedures](http://sops.vatpac.org/controller-skills/coordination/){target=new}, Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that YWE(All) gives **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- MUN to YWE for aircraft **not** on the Y12 or H119 airway  
- WON to YWE for all aircraft  
- YWE to WON for all aircraft
