## Sector Responsibilities
### Yarrowee (YWE)
YWE is responsible for the final sequencing actions in to YMML.

### Wonthaggi (WON)
WON is responsible for issuing STAR Clearances for aircraft arriving at YMML. WON will also initiate sequencing as required for aircraft arriving at YMML.

### Mungo (MUN)
MUN is responsible for issuing STAR Clearances for aircraft arriving at YMML. MUN will also initiate sequencing as required for aircraft arriving at YMML and YPAD.

### Oxley (OXL)
OXL is responsible for issuing STAR Clearances for aircraft arriving at YMML. OXL will also initiate sequencing as required for aircraft arriving at YMML.

### Griffith (GTH)
Just keeping them separated!

### Katoomba (KAT)
KAT is responsible for issuing STAR Clearances for YSCB.  KAT is also responsible for issuing STAR clearance *(but not runway assignment)* to aircraft processed via the ODALE STAR into YSSY. The BIK controller will issue runway assignment to these aircraft on first contact.

!!! example
    *PE211 has departed YBTH for YSSY and is making a departure call*  
    **PE211:** "PE211, 3nm south of Bathurst, passing 5800ft, climbing FL120, estimate REVKI 22"  
    **KAT:** "PE211, identified, cleared to YSSY via REVKI flight plan route, ODALE7 arrival, climb FL120"

## Coordination

### YWE/WON / ML TCU

The Standard assignable level from YWE and WON to ML TCU is `A090`, and assigned the ARBEY #, PORTS #, WAREN #, or WENDY # STAR.

All other aircraft must be voice coordinated to ML TCU prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

The Standard Assignable level from ML TCU to YWE/WON is `F240`, and tracking via CRENA, ESDIG, NEVIS, CORRS, KEPPA, or SUNTI.

Refer to [Melbourne TCU Airspace Division](../../terminal/melbourne/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **MDN** and/or **MDS** are online.
### YWE (All) / ENR

As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that YWE(All) gives **Heads-up Coordination** prior to **20nm** from the boundary in the following scenarios:  
- YWE to ELW/BLA for all aircraft  
- WON to ELW/BLA for all aircraft  
- GTH to BLA for all aircraft  
- KAT to BIK/GUN for aircraft **not** planned via MAKKA  
- MUN to TBD for aircraft **not** on H345 airway*

!!! tip
    **MUN** should aim to handoff aircraft as soon as possible to **TBD**, so they can issue STAR clearance and commence sequencing. Remember, As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#handoffs), the Receiving sector may turn the aircraft 45° left or right and climb/descend to any level. So if required, nominate a restriction.

### YWE/WON/MUN/OXL/GTH/KAT Internal

As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-enr), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **20nm** to boundary.

That being said, it is *advised* that YWE(All) gives **Heads-up Coordination** in the following scenarios:  
- MUN to YWE for aircraft **not** on the Y12 or H119 airway (Changes permitted up to boundary for sequencing/descent purposes)  
- OXL to YWE for aircraft **not** tracking via CANTY (Changes permitted up to boundary for sequencing/descent purposes)  
- WON to YWE for all aircraft  
- YWE to WON for all aircraft  

### KAT / SY TCU

As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#enr-tcu), all aircraft must be **Heads-up coordinated** prior to **20nm** from the boundary.  

The Standard Assignable level from SY TCU to KAT is the lower of `F280` or the `RFL`, and tracking via KADOM.

Refer to [Sydney TCU Airspace Division](../../terminal/sydney/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **SAS**, **SDN** and/or **SDS** are online.

### WON / ESL APP
#### Airspace
By default, **ESL APP** owns the airspace within 30nm ESL, SFC-F200, unless stated otherwise by ad-hoc release or NOTAM.
#### Departures
Departures from YMES in to WON Class C will be coordinated at taxi, and will be requesting a level.

!!! example
    **ESL APP** -> **WON**: "Taxi, ALDN16 for YFLI DCT, Requesting F230"  
    **WON** -> **ESL APP**: "ALDN16, F230"  
    **ESL APP** -> **WON**: "F230, ALDN16"  

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
All aircraft transiting from WON to **ESL APP** must be heads-up coordinated prior to **20nm** from the boundary. Operations within **ESL APP** are fairly ad-hoc, so there are no standard assignable levels, simply whatever the WON and **ESL APP** controller agree on.

!!! example
    **WON** -> **ESL APP**: "via ANTLA, BFRT23, will be assigned F220, I have no restrictions on descent"  
    **ESL APP** -> **WON**: "BFRT23, F220"
