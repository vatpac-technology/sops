Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the WR CTR. Although WR ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ASP(WRA) may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### ASP(WRA)
Coordination is not required between WR ADC and ASP(WRA). Aircraft entering ASP(WRA) airspace shall be handed off, and instructed to contact ASP(WRA) for onwards clearance.
