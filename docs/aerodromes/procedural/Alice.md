## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the AS CTR. Although AS ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ASP may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### Departures
Departures from YBAS in to ASP Class C will be coordinated when ready for departure.
