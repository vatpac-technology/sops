## Separation
### Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the AS CTR. Although AS ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ASP may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination.

## VFR Operations
### VFR Routes
Alice Springs has 10 VFR routes that follow prominent geographic features and highways. These established routes begin at various reporting points, providing entry to the CIRA. VFR Routes 8 and 9 provide separation from R215 Pine Gap.
