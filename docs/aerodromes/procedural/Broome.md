BRM ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace `SFC` to `A055`, as well as the Class E airspace `1200ft AGL` to `A055`, within the BRM CTR.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the BRM CTR. Although BRM ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, TRT(KIY) may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. BRM ADC must inform TRT(KIY) if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BRM ADC** -> **KIY**</span>: "Next, NWK1653"  
    <span class="hotline">**KIY** -> **BRM ADC**</span>: "NWK1653, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**BRM ADC** -> **KIY**</span>: "NWK1653"

The Standard Assignable level from BRM ADC to TRT(KIY) is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
TRT(KIY) will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to BRM ADC

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**KIY** -> **BRM ADC**</span>: "Via CIN, ANO332”  
    <span class="hotline">**BRM ADC** -> **KIY**</span>: "ANO332"  

The Standard Assignable level from TRT(KIY) to BRM ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
