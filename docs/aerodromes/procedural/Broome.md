BRM ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace `SFC` to `A055`, as well as the Class E airspace `1200ft AGL` to `A055`, within the BRM CTR.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Separation
### Local Lateral Separation Points
Due to the convergence of inbound/outbound air routes approaching BRM, the [geographic feature separation standard](../../separation-standards/visual.md#geographic-features) may be useful to efficiently process opposite direction aircraft from the north or south.

The **coastline** is a good reference for this standard.

!!! phraseology
    *FHG is outbound from YBRM for Port Headland (southwest) and has reported visual. An aircraft is inbound to YBRM from the same direction, tracking over land.*  
    **BRM ADC:** "FHG, track to remain at least 1nm offshore, report established"  
    **FHG:** "Track to remain at least 1nm offshore, FHG"  

    **FHG:** "FHG, established 1nm offshore"  
    *FHG is now laterally separated from aircraft over land*  
    **BRM ADC:** "FHG, climb to A085"  
    **FHG:** "Climb to A085, FHG"

### Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the BRM CTR. Although BRM ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, TRT(ASH) may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### Departures
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from BRM ADC to TRT(ASH) for all aircraft **entering TRT(ASH) CTA**.

The Standard Assignable level from **BRM ADC** to **TRT(ASH)** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ---- | ---- |
| All | The lower of `A050` and `RFL` |

### Arrivals/Overfliers
TRT(ASH) will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to BRM ADC

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**ASH** -> **BRM ADC**</span>: "Via CIN, ANO332”  
    <span class="hotline">**BRM ADC** -> **ASH**</span>: "ANO332"  

The Standard Assignable level from TRT(ASH) to BRM ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
