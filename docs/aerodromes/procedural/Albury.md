AY ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the AY CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the AY CTR. Although AY ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ELW(BLA) may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'Next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. AY ADC must inform ELW(BLA) if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "Next, AM324"  
    <span class="hotline">**BLA** -> **AY ADC**</span>: "AM324, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "AM324"

The Standard Assignable level from AY TWR to ELW(BLA) is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
ELW(BLA) will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to AY ADC

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BLA** -> **AY ADC**</span>: "Via ARRAN1 Arrival, RXA6783‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**AY ADC** -> **BLA**</span>: "RXA6783"  

The Standard Assignable level from ELW(BLA) to AY ADC is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
