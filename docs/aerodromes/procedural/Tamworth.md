TW ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the TW CTR, as well as the Class C airspace between `A045` and `A065`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be not available below `A034` in the TW CTR. Although TW ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ARL/MDE may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Runway Operations
Runway 12R/30L shall be used for:

- All single-engine VFR arrivals and departures from the 160 Radial through West to the 295 Radial
- Arrivals via DUA
- Departures via GST or GWT
- Single-engine circuit training

Runway 12L/30R shall be used for all other operations.  
`ERSA FAC YSTW`

## Circuits
Circuits are to be flown in the direction coinciding with the Runway designator (Left/Right) at `A024`.

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. TW ADC must inform ARL/MDE if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "Next, QLK5D"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "QLK5D, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "QLK5D"

The Standard Assignable level from TW ADC to ARL/MDE is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
ARL/MDE will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to TW ADC

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MDE** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "Via MOR DCT for the VOR-A, FD272‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **MDE**</span>: "FD272, VOR-A"  

The Standard Assignable level from ARL/MDE to TW ADC is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
