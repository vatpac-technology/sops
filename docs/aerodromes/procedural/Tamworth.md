## Airspace

</figure>

TW ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the TW CTR, as well as the Class C airspace between `A045` and `A065`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be not available below `A034` in the TW CTR. Although TW ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ARL/MDE may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Local Lateral Separation Points
The positions in each table header below are procedurally separated from each other, provided the conditions in each table row are met. At least one condition must be met in each column.

## Runway Modes
Equal preference is shared between runways 12L/R and 30L/R.

Runway 12R/30L shall be used for:

- All single-engine VFR arrivals and departures from the 160 Radial through West to the 295 Radial
- Arrivals via DUA
- Departures via GST or GWT
- Single-engine circuit training

Runway 12L/30R shall be used for all other operations. 

### Simultaneous Parallel Runway Ops
During day VMC only, simultaneous parallel runway operations may be used between runways 12L/R or 30L/R. The [ATIS](#operational-info) must be updated to reflect this mode. Controllers must closely monitor the base and final legs of the circuit to ensure pilots do not pass through their assigned runway centreline.

In the absense of day VMC, dependent parallel runway operations may be conducted, with an adequate separation standard in place between aircraft operating from adjacent runways.

## Circuits
Circuits are to be flown in the direction coinciding with the Runway designator (Left/Right) at `A024`.

## ATIS
### Operational Info
When parallel runway operations are in use, the ATIS OPR INFO field shall include:  
`SIMUL PARL RWY OPS IN USE. EXP TRAFFIC ON FINAL AND OPP BASE OF THE PARL RWY`

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft entering ARL/MDE CTA when they are next to depart. TW ADC must inform ARL/MDE if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "Next, QLK5D"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "QLK5D, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "QLK5D"

The Standard Assignable level from TW ADC to ARL/MDE is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
ARL/MDE will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to TW ADC

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**MDE** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "Via MOR DCT for the VOR-A, FD272”  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **MDE**</span>: "FD272, VOR-A"  

The Standard Assignable level from ARL/MDE to TW ADC is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
