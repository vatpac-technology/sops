CFS ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the CFS CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be not available below `A028` in the CFS CTR. Although CFS ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ARL(MNN) or INL may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. CFS ADC must inform INL/ARL(MNN) if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "Next, QJE1573"  
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "QJE1573, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "QJE1573"

The Standard Assignable level from CFS ADC to INL/ARL(MNN) is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
### Arrivals/Overfliers
INL/ARL(MNN) will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to CFS ADC.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**INL** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "Via KADSI, RXA6416‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **INL**</span>: "RXA6416"  

The Standard Assignable level from INL/ARL(MNN) to CFS ADC is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
