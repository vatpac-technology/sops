CFS ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the CFS CTR `SFC` to `A045`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be not available below `A028` in the CFS CTR. Although CFS ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, ARL(MNN) or INL may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Local Lateral Separation Points
Due to the convergence of inbound/outbound air routes approaching CFS, the [geographic feature separation standard](../../separation-standards/visual.md#geographic-features) may be useful to efficiently process opposite direction aircraft from the north or south.

The **coastline** is a good reference for this standard. Due to high terrain close to the coast, it is recommended that the offshore aircraft be positioned at least 1nm from the geographical feature (the coast), allowing the aircraft over land to maintain adequate separation with terrain.

!!! phraseology
    *RXA6418 is inbound to YCFS from the south and has reported visual. They are vertically separated from an outbound aircraft departing YCFS to the south.*  
    **CFS ADC:** "RXA6418, track to remain 1nm offshore, report established"  
    **RXA6418:** "Track to remain 1nm offshore, RXA6418"  

    **RXA6418:** "RXA6418, established 1nm offshore"  
    *RXA6418 is now laterally separated from aircraft over land, allowing ADC to issue further descent.*  
    **CFS ADC:** "RXA6418, descend to A050"  
    **RXA6418:** "Descend A050, RXA6418"  

    *Once both aircraft have passed and/or another separation standard is available (e.g. vertical separation), the geographic feature standard can be relaxed.*  
    **CFS ADC:** "RXA6418, cancel the offshore requirement, track for downwind runway 21, cleared visual approach"

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft entering INL/ARL(MNN) CTA when they are next to depart. CFS ADC must inform INL/ARL(MNN) if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "Next, QJE1573"  
    <span class="hotline">**MNN** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "QJE1573, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **MNN**</span>: "QJE1573"

The Standard Assignable level from CFS ADC to INL/ARL(MNN) is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
INL/ARL(MNN) will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to CFS ADC.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**INL** -> **CFS ADC**</span>: "Via KADSI, RXA6416‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**CFS ADC** -> **INL**</span>: "RXA6416"  

The Standard Assignable level from INL/ARL(MNN) to CFS ADC is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
