## SID Selection

Aircraft planned via **JUSTY**, or **ML**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint.

Aircraft **not** planned via **JUSTY**, or **ML**, shall be assigned an appropriate **Procedural SID** or a visual departure.


## Arrivals
IFR arrivals from the following fixes may be cleared via STAR as indicated:

| Arrival Fix | STAR |
| ------ | ----------|
| **Northwest / North / Northeast** KEPPA / CANTY   | JAYBI / APPLE or CANTY transition |
| **Northeast / East / Southeast** ML    | JAYBI / ML transition |

!!! Note
    All jet aircraft shall be cleared via TEMPL, DCT AV or the RNAV IAF.
    
Unless otherwise coordinated and subject to Class E traffic requirements, aircraft shall be transferred to AV TWR no later than:

| Procedure | Transfer point |
| ------ | ----------|
| Visual Approach | On base or final, no later than 5 NM |
| ILS, LOC, VOR or RNAV  | As soon as practical, no later than 10 NM to run |
| DME/GPS Arrival  | At 10 NM established inbound |

## Sequencing

AV TWR is responsible for sequencing any aircraft operating in airspace released to the tower, with respect to aircraft arriving from ML TCU. 

## Separation

Within 5 NM of AV, AV TWR must provide separation between:
    a) Departures from all runways and HLS at Avalon; and
    b) All traffic operating in airspace released to AV TWR.
