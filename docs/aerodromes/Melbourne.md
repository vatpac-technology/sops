## Airspace
### Sunbury Corridor
**ML ADC** is responsible for the Sunbury Corridor airspace as shown below. It is only available to Day VFR Helicopters.

Due to the close proximity of the airspace to the arrival and departure paths at YMML, controllers should be aware of surrounding traffic before issuing a clearance to helicopters.

!!! example
    **HEMS3:** "Melbourne Tower, HEMS3, approaching Sunbury Water Tank, A020, for Essendon via the Sunbury Corridor, request clearance"  
    **ML ADC:** "HEMS3, cleared to Essendon, track Sunbury Corridor, not above A020"  
    **HEMS3:** "Cleared to Essendon, track Sunbury Corridor, not above A020, HEMS3"

If necessary, consider issuing a clearance limit for separation or instruct helicopters to report sighting and to maintain own separation with other aircraft.  Alternatively, tower controllers can simulate visual separation provided no risk of collision exists and both aircraft remain in sight of the controller at all times. 

!!! example
    **ML ADC:** "HEMS3, report sighting a Jetstar A320, 4nm final runway 16"  
    **HEMS3:** "Traffic sighted, HEMS3"  
    **ML ADC:** "HEMS3, pass behind that aircraft, maintain own separation, caution wake turbulence"  
    **HEMS3:** "Pass behind the A320, maintain own separation, HEMS3"

Remember to pass traffic information to both aircraft.

!!! example
    **ML ADC:** "JST515, traffic is a helicopter, 2nm northwest of the field, tracking for Essendon and maintaining own separation with you, runway 16, cleared to land"  
    **JST515:** "Runway 16, cleared to land, JST515"

## Runway Modes
If winds are too great, single runway operations may be necessary (eg, Runway 16 for Arrivals and Departures). However, pending wind limitations (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), the following runway modes are to be used

| Mode | Arrivals  | Departures |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 27AD/34D   | 27       | 34 (Departures NE), 27 (All other deps)        |
| 16A/27D    | 16 | 27  |

!!! information
    "Departures NE" means departures via MNG, NONIX and DOSEL. Runway 34 for departure may also be more suitable during this runway mode for heavy aircraft, and aircraft taxiing from the southern apron.

#### SID Selection

Jet Aircraft planned via **MNG**, **NONIX**, **DOSEL**, **CORRS**, **KEPPA**, **NEVIS**, **SUNTI**, **ESDIG**, or **CRENA**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

!!! example
    Jet Aircraft planned via DOSEL, assigned runway 27, shall be given the DOSEL SID.

Jet aircraft planned via **MNG**, **NONIX**, **DOSEL**, **KEPPA**, or **NEVIS**, using Runway 16 for departure **Off Mode**, shall be assigned the **KAGMU** SID.

!!! definition
    **Off Mode:** Aircraft departing from a runway not prescribed as active for departures on the ATIS. For example, a heavy aircraft that operationally requires Runway 16 for departure during the 16A/27D Mode.

a) Jet aircraft departing **Off Mode** that don't meet the above critera; or  
b) Non-Jet Aircraft; or  
c) All aircraft using Runway 09; or  
d) Aircraft that cannot accept a Procedural SID  
Shall be assigned the **Radar SID**.

!!! example
    Non-Jet Aircraft planned via DOSEL, assigned runway 34, shall be given the ML (RADAR) SID.

## ATIS

### ATIS Identifier
YMML ATIS identifiers only uses letters `N` through to `Y`, due to nearby YMEN using letters `A` through `M`.  

### Approach Expectation
With **Runway 34** in use for arrivals and the cloud base above `A030` but below `A042`, the APCH field shall include:  
`ACFT ON THE ALPHA STAR EXP INSTR APCH` 

This permits controllers to assign aircraft either the Alpha or Victor STAR and process them for a GLS/RNP approach or a visual approach (depending on traffic flow and pilot preference).

## Coordination
### ML ADC / ML TCU
#### Auto Release

!!! important
    Melbourne utilises auto release for all **procedural** SIDs and the **ML (RADAR)** SID provided aircraft are assigned the Standard Assignable Level and a [Standard Assignable Heading](#standard-assignable-departure-headings).

'Next' coordination is required for aircraft that are:   
a) Departing from a non-ATIS runway; or  
b) Assigned a level other than `A050`; or  
c) Requiring an assigned heading other than a Standard Assignable Heading; or
d) The next departure after a go around

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**ML ADC** -> **ML TCU**</span>: "Next, JIA, runway 34"  
    <span class="hotline">**ML TCU** -> **ML ADC**</span>: "JIA, Track Extended Centreline, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**ML ADC** -> **ML TCU**</span>: "Track Extended Centreline, unrestricted, JIA"  

    **ML ADC**: "JIA, Track Extended Centreline 340 degrees, Runway 34, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    **JIA**: "Track Extended Centreline 340 degrees, Runway 34, Cleared for Takeoff, JIA"

### Runway Change
Any runway change must be prior coordinated to **MAE** and **EN ADC**.

## Departures Controller

Refer to [Melbourne TCU Airspace Division](../../terminal/melbourne/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **MDN** and/or **MDS** are online.

## Standard Assignable Departure Headings

Aircraft that have been cleared the **ML (RADAR) SID** must receive an assigned heading with their line up or takeoff clearance. 'Next' coordination is not required to the ML TCU controller when the departing aircraft has been assigned the standard assignable level and assigned one of the headings listed below:

| Runway | W | NE | SE | S |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 16* | 290 | 290 | 160 | 260 |
| 27 | 320 | 290 | 260 | 260 |
| 34 | 340 | 340 | 340 | 260 |


*\*When Runway 09 is in use for arrivals, all Runway 16 departures shall be assigned heading 160.*

When Runway 09 is in use for departures, ML TCU shall nominate a heading to ML ADC for use as a standard assignable heading.

## Standard Assignable Levels
All Aircraft: `A050` or `RFL` if lower
