## Procedure Assignment

Our Controller Clients will usually assign the most suitable departure for that aircraft's flight plan, although is is important to understand the Departures and their typical assignment rules.

### Visual Departures

!!! info
    Visual departures are almost never given in Tauranga, due to the SID being cancelled early by Bay Approach. Most aircraft will typically be cleared direct the transition fix, traffic depending.
