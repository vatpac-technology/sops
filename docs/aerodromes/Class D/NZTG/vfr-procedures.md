### Rule Of Thumb

All arriving aircraft should keep seawards of the coastline, allowing for departing aircraft to pass on the land-side of the coast. This general rule is a safe way to keep traffic flowing efficiently in and out of the Aerodrome.


### Arrivals

All Arriving VFR aircraft should reference the preferred [VFR arrival procedures as listed in the NZ AIP](https://www.aip.net.nz/assets/AIP/Aerodrome-Charts/Tauranga-NZTG/NZTG_35.1_35.2.pdf){ target=blank }.

These standard VFR departures should be issued where possible, to ensure the safe and efficient flow of traffic is maintained.
