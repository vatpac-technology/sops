### Approaches

All arrivals terminate at `RUSTA` or `MORTA`, which are the IAF for the RNAV approach.

If aircraft are visual they can report "`Callsign, IAF, inbound, visual RNAV 07`". It is then up to the Controllers discretion whether the aircraft is cleared visual or not. 

### Missed Approach

In the event of a missed approach, aicraft should be instructed to carry out the published missed approach procedure. This will have the aircraft climbing to 2000 feet, turning left direct to `LETGU`, before holding at `RUSTA` 5000 feet or above. Aircrft can then be re-cleared for the RNAV approach, or cleared a visual approach, should the conditions be suitable.
