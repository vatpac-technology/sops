In the absence of an ACD controller, SMC shall asssume the ACD responsibilities.  
In the absence of an SMC controller, ADC shall assume the SMC and ACD responsibilities.

## Departures
RNAV jet-aircraft planned via APAGI shall be issued the APAGI SID.  
!!! note
    For RNP (0.3) approved operators, the RWY14 CUDGN SID and RWY32 BURLI SID are available for departures via APAGI.  
Gold Coast radar SID shall be assigned to all other IFR aircraft, except those assigned Runway 35.  
IFR departures from Runway 35 shall be assigned a visual departure.  

Radar SID aircraft shall be cleared subject to the following conditions for noise abatement purposes:

| Via             | 14      | 32       |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
|  **North**   |   Left (14)/Right (32) turn and then over water until 3,000 ft    | Left (14)/Right (32) turn and then over water until 3,000 ft |
|  **East**   |   Left (14)/Right (32) turn and then over water until 3,000 ft      | Left (14)/Right (32) turn and then over water until 3,000 ft |
|  **South** Jets   |   Minor right turn then over water until 5 DME   |    Over water until south of Kingscliff (CG130/7 NM) and 5,000 ft     |
|  **South** Non-Jets  |    left(14)/right(32) turn and then over water until 3,000 ft     |Left (14)/Right (32) turn and then over water until 3,000 ft  |


## Arrivals
Arriving aircraft that are operating at or below 1,500 ft may contact ADC for inbound clearance. These aircraft shall be assigned a discrete SSR code but shall not be radar identified.  
Aircraft shall be cleared subject to the following conditions:

| Via             | 14      | 32       |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
|  **North** Jets   |  Not below 5,000 ft until vectored over water to join final    | Via right circuit for 10 NM final or right base south of Point Danger  |
|  **North** Non-Jets   |   Not below 3,000 ft until vectored over water to join final   | Via right circuit for 10 NM final or right base south of Point Danger  |
|  **East**   |   Via LAMSI STAR or over water until final   |    Join 10 NM final   |
|  **South** Jets   |    Via STAR or not below 5,000 ft until over water to join final |  Via STAR to join final  |
|  **South** Non-Jets   |    Via STAR or not below 3,000 ft until over water to join final |  **IMC:** via STAR or **VMC:** Join left base for 2 NM final |

## Runway Selection
Preferred runway is Runway 14 - all hours
The crosswind Runways 17/35 may be used at the same time as the main runways.

### Preferred RWY 14 Approach (All Hours) - Noise Abatement
Turbo Jet and non turbo Jet aircraft above 5,700KG MTOW (unless due weather or critical operations requirements) - Approach priorities:  
RNAV-W (RNP) RWY 14, RNAV-Y (RNP) RWY 14  
RNAV-Z (GNSS) RWY 14, VISUAL APCH RWY 14  
ILS RWY 14  

### Circuit Direction
Circuits are to be conducted at 1,000 ft AGL.  

| Runway               | Direction       |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 14 | Left  |
| 32 | Right  |
| 17 | Left | 
| 35 | Right    | 

## VFR Procedures

Aircraft transiting the Gold Coast CTR shall be cleared via the inland VFR route.  
Aircraft tracking southbound should contact ADC at Robina Town Centre (ROT) for clearance.  
Aircraft tracking northbound should contact ADC approaching Cudgen Lake for clearance.  
Aircraft requiring to transit the CTR coastal will be subject to delays depending on traffic in the Gold Coast CTR.  

## Airspace
Tower airspace is defined as between SFC to 1500 FT

## Tower Closed Procedures
When ADC and the Brisbane TCU unit responsible for BAC is closed:  
Gold Coast aerodrome shall be considered uncontrolled and pilots will operate using the CTAF.  
Gold Coast Class C airspace below 3,500 ft shall be re-classified Class G.  
When ADC is closed and the Brisbane TCU unit responsible for BAC is open, that unit will provide a Gold Coast aerodrome control service.

## Helicopter Operations
Local helicopter operations are conducted on the Western Grass which is the area contained by blue gable markers north of the VOR and west of the runway intersection. This is marked on the aerodrome chart as “HELO OPS”.
!!! note
    Western Grass is outside of the maneuvering area and is not controlled by ATC – no take-off or landing clearances shall be provided for this area.

The HLS (Helipad) is located between the GA Apron and Taxiway Golf. 
Circuits from the Western Grass are to be made in the same direction as the duty runway.
