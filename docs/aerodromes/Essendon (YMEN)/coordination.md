## EN SMC / ML TCU

When an aircraft requests start clearance, the EN SMC controller shall coordinate with ML TCU to obtain the start clearance.

## EN ADC / ML TCU

### Departures
Essendon departures that will not enter ML TCU Class C airspace are not required to be coordinated.

All IFR departures and VFR aircraft departing into Class C must be coordinated to ML TCU with a "Next" Call

!!! example
    **ML ADC** -> **ML TCU**: "Next, ABC"  
    **ML TCU** -> **ML ADC**: "ABC, Unrestricted"  
    **ML ADC** -> **ML TCU**: "Unrestricted, ABC" 
    `AIP GEN 3.4`

### Arrivals

MAE must relay sequence to EN TWR, including transferring radar identification, prior to the aircraft reaching 15 NM from EN or 4 minutes from the Arrival Gate.

Sequence information must include:
    a) Arrival gate or circuit entry
    b) Runway (if other than ATIS nominated)

!!! Note
    For aircraft not tracking via an Arrival Gate (see ML TCU shall clear aircraft for approach via the appropriate arrival gate:), ML TCU is required to coordinate descent of aircraft into EN TWR airspace.

When “The Coffin” is released, coordinate any use of Runway 27 with EN TWR prior to use.

## ML ADC / EN ADC
EN TWR must advise ML TWR when “The Coffin” is activated or deactivated.

EN TWR must advise ML TWR, for traffic awareness, when an ad hoc airspace release to EN TWR will cause an aircraft to pass within 3 NM of any runway at ML.

## Runway Change
Any Runway change must be prior coordinated to **MAE**

## Standard Assignable Departure Levels

All Aircraft: `A030` or `RFL` if lower
