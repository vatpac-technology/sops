## BK SMC / SY TCU

### Taxi Call

Whilst the aircraft is taxiing, the Ground Controller Coordinate with the controller responsible for SDS who will issue their airways clearance.
!!! example
    **BK SMC** -> **SY TCU**: "Taxi's, UJN, Dubbo, 29C”  
    **SY TCU** -> **BK SMC**: “UJN, Cleared to Dubbo via KADOM Flight Planned Route, Bankstown 8 Departure, Climb via SID A030, Squawk 3342”  
    **BK SMC** -> **SY TCU**: “Cleared to Dubbo via KADOM Flight Planned Route, Bankstown 8 Departure, Climb via SID A030, Squawk 3342, UJN”  


## BK ADC / SY TCU

### Next Call

Tower will now coordinate with the relevant Class C sector above them for permission to release the aircraft into their CTA.

!!! example
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: "Next, UJN, 29C”  
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “UJN, Unrestricted"

!!! information
    Keep in mind some Class D aerodromes only allow 1 IFR aircraft in the CTR at any one time so Approach Centre Controllers will either approve or deny the release of the aircraft until there is a slot available for them.

Once the aircraft is clear of the Class D CTR either vertically or laterally the tower controller will tell them to contact the relevant frequency. 

## SY TCU / BK TWR

### Arrival Coordination

SY TCU will coordinate with BK ADC for incoming IFR arrivals on either Visual Tracking, RNP or NDB approaches

#### Visual Tracking

!!! example
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Estimate, UJN via TWRN time 02.”  
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: “UJN” 

#### IAP Tracking

!!! example
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Estimated Approach Time, UJN via RNP at time 59”  
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: “via RNP, UJN”   
    **BK Tower Must Clear Aircraft for Final, before SY TCU issues approach clearance.**  
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Request clearance for final, UJN”  
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: “UJN Cleared RNP 11C” 
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Cleared RNP 11C, UJN”  

## SDS / SY TCU

### Miscellaneous

If departure is Runway 11 into CTA, coordination is required with Director (or SDS) if open, as the "Half a Radar Sep Standard From Sector Boundary" rule.

!!! Example
    **SDS** -> **SY TCU**: “Request left turn our of Bankstown”  
    **SY TCU** -> **SDS**: "Approved" (no callsigns need be used here)  

## Standard Assignable Departure Levels
