# BK SMC / SY TCU

Whilst the aircraft is taxiing, the Ground Controller Coordinate with the relevant Approach/Enroute controllers who will issue their airways clearance.
!!! example
    BK SMC: “UJN Next”  
    SY TCU: “UJN, Cleared to Dubbo via KADOM Flight Planned Route, Bankstown 8 Departure, Climb via SID A030, Squawk 3342”  
    BK SMC: “Cleared to Dubbo via KADOM Flight Planned Route, Bankstown 8 Departure, Climb via SID A030, Squawk 3342, UJN”  


# BK TWR / SY TCU

Tower will now coordinate with the relevant Class C sector above them for permission to release the aircraft into their CTA.
!!! information
    Keep in mind some Class D aerodromes only allow 1 IFR aircraft in the CTR at any one time so Approach Centre Controllers will either approve or deny the release of the aircraft until there is a slot available for them.
Once the aircraft is clear of the Class D CTR either vertically or laterally the tower controller will tell them to contact the relevant frequency. 


# SY TCU / BK TWR

SY TCU will coordinate with BK TWR for incoming IFR arrivals on either the RNP or NDB approaches
!!! example
    SY TCU: “UJN, RNP 11C, ETA time 11”  
    BK TWR: “UJN, RNP 11C, ETA time 11”
