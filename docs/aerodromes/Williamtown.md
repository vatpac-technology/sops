## Coordination
### Departures
'Next' coordination is **not** required from WLM ADC to WLM TCU for aircraft that are:  
a) Departing from a runway nominated in the ATIS; and  
b) Assigned the standard assignable level;  
c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID  

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**WLM ADC** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "Next, MVP"  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **WLM ADC**</span>: "MVP, Left Heading 010, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM ADC** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "Left Heading 010, MVP"  

The Standard Assignable level from WLM ADC to WLM TCU is the lower of `F120` or the `RFL`.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless coordination is in place from WLM TCU to WLM ADC for arrivals cleared for an approach on to a runway nominated on the ATIS. All other aircraft and all overfliers must be heads-up coordinated as soon as practical.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**WLM TCU** -> **WLM ADC**</span>: "via WLM, ZULU, Close formation of 5, do you have any restrictions or requirements?‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**WLM ADC** -> **WLM TCU**</span>: "ZULU, no restrictions or requirements, A040"
