## Surveillance
BRM ADC is permitted to use Surveillance standards for separation. Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the BRM CTR.  
For simulation purposes, visual separation is assumed to exist below the cloud base, and within 5nm. Visual separation can still be used to separate from aircraft on an instrument approach, below the cloud base.
## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. BRM ADC must inform TRT(KIY) if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BRM ADC** -> **KIY**</span>: "Next, NWK1653"  
    <span class="hotline">**KIY** -> **BRM ADC**</span>: "NWK1653"

The Standard Assignable level from BRM ADC to TRT(KIY) is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals
TRT(KIY) will coordinate the sequence to BRM ADC

!!! example
    <span class="coldline">**KIY** -> **BRM ADC**</span>: "New Sequence of 2. Via CIN, ANO332, Number 1. Via MASIM, VOZ1481, Number 2‚Äù  
    <span class="coldline">**BRM ADC** -> **KIY**</span>: "ANO332, Number 1. VOZ1481, Number 2"  

The Standard Assignable level from TRT(KIY) to BRM ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
