## Airspace
AV ADC is not responsible for any airspace by default.  
AV ADC may request a *release* of the **Class D** airspace in the AV CTR from ML TCU to facilitate circuit operations, if required.

## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **ML** shall be assigned the **JUSTY** SID.

Aircraft **not** planned via **ML**, and tracking to the North East, shall be recleared via ML, and assigned the **JUSTY** SID.

All other IFR aircraft shall be assigned the **Radar SID**.

### Circuit Direction
| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 18     | Left  |
| 36     | Right |

## Coordination
### ML TCU
#### Departures
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required to ML TCU for aircraft that are:  

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to ML TCU.

The Standard Assignable level from **AV ADC** to **ML TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ----- | -------| 
| All | The lower of `A040` and `RFL` |

#### Runway Change
Any Runway change must be prior coordinated to the relevant [TCU Controller](#tcu-controller).

#### TCU Controller
When multiple ML TCU controllers are online, the relevant TCU controller is whoever is responsible for **MAV**.
