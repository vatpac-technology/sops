## Coordination
### Departures
#### Auto Release
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required to **RKA** for aircraft that are: 

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID; or  
- Not entering RKA CTA

The Standard Assignable level from **MK/RK ADC** to **MKA/RKA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ---- | ---- |
| All | The lower of `A060` and `RFL` |

#### MK/RK SMC
The controller assuming responsibility of **SMC** shall give heads-up coordination to **RKA** controller prior to the issue of the following clearances:  

- VFR departures entering RKA CTA
- Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS

### Arrivals/Overfliers
RKA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to RK ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to RK ADC, unless RK ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.
