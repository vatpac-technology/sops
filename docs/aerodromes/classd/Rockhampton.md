Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Coordination
### Departures
#### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required to **RKA** for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**RK ADC** -> **RKA**</span>: "Next, VJE"  
    <span class="hotline">**RKA** -> **RK ADC**</span>: "VJE, Track Extended Centreline, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**RK ADC** -> **RKA**</span>: "Track Extended Centreline, VJE"

The TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **RKA**.

The Standard Assignable level from MK/RK ADC to MKA/RKA is the lower of `A060` or the `RFL`.

#### MK/RK SMC
The controller assuming responsibility of **SMC** shall give heads-up coordination to **RKA** controller prior to the issue of the following clearances:  

- VFR Departures  
- Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS

### Arrivals/Overfliers
RKA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to RK ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to RK ADC, unless RK ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**RKA** -> **RK ADC**</span>: "Via SARUS for the visual approach, VJN‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**RK ADC** -> **RKA**</span>: "VJN, visual approach"
