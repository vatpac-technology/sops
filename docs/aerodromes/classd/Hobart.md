Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## SID Selection
Jet Aircraft planned via **RIBLI**, **LATUM**, or **LAVOP**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint.

Non-Jet Aircraft planned via **RIBLI**, **KANLI**, or **LAVOP**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint.

Other aircraft shall be assigned an appropriate **Procedural SID** or a visual departure.

## ATIS
YMHB ATIS identifiers range from `N` to `Y`, as YMLT uses `A` through `M`. 

## Cambridge (YCBG)
Due to it's close proximity, HB ADC & SMC are responsible for clearances into and out of Cambridge (YCBG), which sits inside the Hobart Class D control zone.

### Departures
Prior to leaving the apron, all outbound aircraft will establish communications with **HB SMC** for Airways Clearance.  

All IFR Aircraft departing Cambridge shall be assigned a **Visual Departure** or one of Hobart's **Procedural SIDs**.

!!! note
    Both VFR and IFR aircraft require a clearance to operate in Class D airspace (even if this is an implied clearance to depart a leg of the circuit).  The examples below show an IFR aircraft departing.

!!! Example
    **NDR:** "Hobart Ground, NDR, for Devonport, Request Clearance"  
    **HB SMC:** "NDR, Cleared to Devonport via KANLI flight plan route, KANLI3 Departure, Climb via SID A045, Squawk 4432"

When ready to taxi and prior to leaving the apron aircraft must contact **HB ADC**, advising intended runway for departure and receipt of YMHB ATIS, to obtain traffic information.

!!! Example
    **NDR:** "Hobart Tower, NDR, taxiing Cambridge Runway 32, received Hobart Information D"  
    **HB ADC:** "NDR, No reported IFR traffic, report ready"  
    **NDR:** "Wilco, NDR"

Takeoff clearances are not given. Aircraft will remain clear of the active runway and report ready to HB ADC. Aircraft must not enter an active runway or become airborne until departure instructions have been issued.

!!! Example
    **NDR:** "NDR, Ready"  
    **HB ADC:** "NDR, track via the KANLI3 departure, report airborne"  
    **NDR:** "Track via the KANLI3 departure, wilco, NDR"


### Arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft should be instructed to join a leg of the circuit and cleared for a visual approach (traffic permitting).  In IMC, IFR aircraft will fly one of Hobart's instrument approaches until visual, then break off to circle to land.

As a landing clearance is not given, aircraft should instead be informed of any traffic operating on the aerodrome and instructed to report clear of the runway.

!!! example
    *UJA is an IFR Aero Commander who has been cleared the YMHB RNAV-Z RWY 30 approach by HB APP and handed off to HB ADC.*  
    **UJA:** "Hobart Tower, UJA"  
    **HB ADC:** "UJA, Hobart Tower, report visual"  
    **UJA:** "Wilco, UJA"  

    **UJA:** "UJA, visual"  
    **HB ADC:** "UJA, track for final runway 30, no reported traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **UJA:** "Track for final runway 30, wilco, UJA"

!!! example
    *KLR is a VFR Cherokee who is tracking inbound on the Victor East VFR route.*  
    **HB ADC:** "KLR, enter the control zone tracking via the Victor East, A015, clearance limit Sorell"  
    **KLR:** "Enter control zone tracking via the Victor East, A015, clearance limit Sorell, KLR"  

    **KLR:** "KLR, approaching Sorell"  
    **HB ADC:** "KLR, join base runway 12, cleared visual approach, no reported traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **KLR:** "Join base runway 12, cleared visual approach, wilco, KLR"

## VFR Operations

### Circuit Direction

| ------ | ----------|
| 12     | Left  |
| 30     | Right |

| Northeast |  CBV-CPA-Orielton-SORL east of Colebrook Road to CPA then Orielton east of Tasman HWY to SORL |  As directed by ATC to SORL then Orielton east of Tasman HWY, thence east of Colebrook Rd east of CPA to CBV   | 
| East      |  DLY-SORL north of the Arthur HWY        |  As directed by ATC to SORL   |

Clearances for aircraft entering the CTR must be worded so as to leave no possibility for misinterpretation by the pilot.

!!! Example
    **NDR:** "Hobart Tower, NDR, CPA, A015, on the Victor Northwest, received Romeo, request clearance"  
    **HB ADC:** "NDR, enter the CTR tracking via the Victor Northwest at A015."

## Coordination
### Departures
'Next' coordination is **not** required to HBA for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to HBA.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**HB ADC** -> **HBA**</span>: "Next, ABC, runway 12"  
    <span class="hotline">**HBA** -> **HB ADC**</span>: "ABC, Heading 150 Visual, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**HB ADC** -> **HBA**</span>: "Heading 150 Visual, ABC"  

    **HB ADC**: "ABC, Assigned heading right 150 Visual, Runway 12, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    **ABC**: "Right heading 150 Visual, Runway 12, Cleared for Takeoff, ABC"

The HBA controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **HB ADC**.

!!! Note
    "Next" Coordination to HBA is not required for aircraft assigned a **Procedural SID** and the Standard Assignable Level.

**HB SMC** shall give heads-up coordination to HBA controller prior to the issue of the following clearances:  
a) VFR Departures  
b) Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS

The Standard Assignable level from HB ADC to HBA is:  
For IFR Aircraft: `A080`  
For VFR Aircraft: The lower of `A045` or the `RFL`.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
HBA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to HB ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to HB ADC, unless HB ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**HBA** -> **HB ADC**</span>: "via BAVUR for the RNAV-W RWY 12, QJE1551"  
    <span class="hotline">**HB ADC** -> **HBA**</span>: "QJE1551, RNP-W RWY 12"
