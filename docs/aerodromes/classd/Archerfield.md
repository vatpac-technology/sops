!!! abstract "Non-Standard Positions"
    :material-information-outline: Non-standard positions may only be used in accordance with [VATPAC Air Traffic Services Policy](https://vatpac.org/publications/policies){target=new}.  
    Approval must be sought from the **bolded parent position** prior to opening a Non-Standard Position, unless [NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} indicate otherwise (eg, for events).

### Dual ADC Operations
When Archerfield ADC North is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC South takes responsibility for the South/East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10R, 28L, 04R, 22L**).

ADC North takes responsibility for the North/West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10L, 28R, 04L, 22R**).

ADC North is **not permitted** online when *Single Runway* Operations are in use.

Refer to the [ATIS section](#dual-adc-operations_2) for information on ATIS formatting when ADC North is online.

## Airspace
AF ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the AF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

### Dual ADC Operations
Airspace Ownership when ADC North is online, is split down the middle of the two active extended centrelines.

## VFR Procedures
### Arrivals
VFR aircraft should track via a VFR inbound point at `A015` and be instructed as below:

| VFR Approach Point | RWYs 04  | RWYs 22 | RWYs 10  | RWYs 28 | 
| ----------------   | --------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| TVT    |  *"Join Base RWY 04L, report CBRG"* | *"Join Base RWY 22R, report CBRG"* | *"Join Final RWY 10L, report CBRG"* | *"Join Downwind RWY 28R, maintain A015, report CBRG"* |
| GON    |  *"Join Final RWY 04L"*                             | *"Join Downwind RWY 22R, maintain A015"*                          | *"Join Final RWY 10R"* | *"Join Downwind RWY 28L, maintain A015"*        |
| PKR   |  *"Join Base RWY 04R, report Logan Motorway"*     | *"Join Base RWY 22L, report Logan Motorway"*     | *"Join Base RWY 10R, report Logan Motorway"*  | *"Join Base 28L, report Logan Motorway"*         |
| TAR       |  *"Join Base RWY 04R"*                              | *"Join Base RWY 22L"*                              | *"Join Downwind RWY 10R, maintain A015"*       | *"Join Final RWY 28L"*        |

!!! note
    Aircraft joining downwind are instructed to maintain `A015` for separation with aircraft departing the zone at `A010`.  Once inbound aircraft are clear of the departure track, they should be *"cleared visual approach"*.

### Departures

| Planned Departure Tracks | "Intentions"   | Tracking Requirement | 
| ---------------      | ---------      | ----------           | 
| BTN 310 & 019 DEG    | Northern Departure | Track via WTBG | 
| BTN 020 & 099 DEG    | Eastern Departure  | Track via Gateway Motorway and Pacific Motorway Intersection<br>*(Not available when Rwy 22 active unless departing into Class C)* | 
| BTN 100 & 204 DEG    | Southern Departure | Track 135 until clear of the zone |
| BTN 205 & 309 DEG    | Western Departure  | Track between 220 & 309 until clear of the zone<br>*(Acft must nominate outbound DEP track with TAXI call)* |
| Other                |                    | As approved by ATC

VFR departures will depart the control zone at `A010`.

Aircraft should advise planned Departure Procedure to **AF SMC** with TAXI call and **AF ADC** with READY call.

!!! phraseology
    **VPF:** "Archer Ground, Cherokee VPF, Main Apron, for a Western Departure, received information Alpha, request taxi"

    **VPF:** "Archer Tower, Cherokee VPF, holding point B8, runway 10 Left, for Western Departure, ready"

## Circuits
The circuit direction changes depending on time of day and runway being used.

| Runway | Day  | Night |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 04R             | Right | -  |
| 04L             | Left  | -  |
| 22R             | Right | -  |
| 22L             | Left  | -  |
| 10R             | Right | -  |
| 10L             | Left  | Left  |
| 28R             | Right | Right |
| 28L             | Left  | -  |

Circuits are to be flown at `A010`.

## Helicopter Operations
Archerfield has three helipads located around the aerodrome:

- **Central Helipad**, on the southern side of Taxiway Foxtrot
- **Northern Helipad**, adjacent the north-eastern end of Runway 04R/22L
- The **Queensland Government Air facility** used by rescue helicopters, north of Taxiway B5

!!! note
    Both the **Northern** and **Central** helipads are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from AF ADC. Helicopters operating on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas should be instructed to *"report airborne"*  or *"report on the ground"* so the controllers knows when they are active/no longer active in their airspace. 

### Training Areas
There are 3 designated helicopter training areas which can be used for training operations in ground effect and circuits. The active helicopter training area shall be nominated on the [ATIS](#helicopter-area).

| Name | Lateral Boundary | Vertical Limit | Capacity |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Area A | North of Taxiway B within the confines of the aerodrome boundary, clear of all buildings | Not above `A005` | 3 helicopters in the circuit area, and additionally<br>2 helicopters in ground effect |
| Area B | North and west of Runway 04L within the confines of the aerodrome boundary, clear of all buildings | Not above `A005` | 3 helicopters in the circuit area, and additionally<br>2 helicopters in ground effect |
| Area C | South and east of Taxiway D, inside the fixed wing circuit for Runway 04R/22L, east of the control tower<br>*All landings to be conducted north of Taxiway B* | Not above `A008` | 2 helicopters |

<figure markdown> 
  ![Archerfield Helicopter Training Areas](img/ybaf_helicopter_area.png){ width="450" }
  <figcaption>Archerfield Helicopter Training Areas</figcaption>
</figure>

With **Runways 28 or 10** in use, **Area A** shall be designated as the active helicopter area. With **Runways 04 or 22** in use, **Area C** shall be designated.

!!! tip
    With **Runways 28 or 10** in use and a large number of helicopters operating in **Area A**, it may be beneficial to instead utilise both **Areas B & C** concurrently.

### Departures
Helicopters depart the zone via any of the [designated outbound routes](#vfr-departure-procedures). Departures shall be parallel to and clear of the duty runways.   

#### Uni Departure
Departures with intended entry into BN CTR northbound shall depart the zone via the **Uni Departure**. Aircraft on the Uni Departure depart via UQLD at `A010`, then contact BN TCU for airways clearance. No heads-up coordination with BN TCU is required.

!!! phraseology 
    **TUY:** "Archer Tower, helicopter TUY, northen pad, for uni departure, ready"  
    **AF ADC:** "TUY, Archer Tower, northen pad, cleared for takeoff"  
    **TUY:** "Cleared for takeoff, northen pad, TUY"

### Arrivals
Helicopters enter the zone from any of the [designated inbound reporting points](#vfr-arrival-procedures). Pilots shall nominate their desired HLS on first contact with AF ADC. If necessary, helicopters may be instructed to overfly the runway complex not below `A005` for a short circuit to the designated HLS.

!!! phraseology 
    **82Y:** "Archer Tower, helicopter 82Y, UQLD A010, recieved Foxtrot, inbound northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "82Y, Archer Tower, track direct northen pad, report 1 mile"  
    **82Y:** "Track direct northern pad, 82Y"  

    **82Y:** "82Y, 1 mile, northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "82Y, cleared to land northern pad"  
    **82Y:** "Cleared to land northen pad, 82Y"

Helicopters inbound for the Queensland Government Air facility HLS shall be issued a standard fixed wing circuit instruction for the applicable duty runway, complying with fixed wing operations unless another approach is requested or desired.

Helicopters inbound from the south via PKR for either the northen or central helipad shall be instructed to "cross 10L and 10R" alongside any other tracking or traffic information.

!!! phraseology 
    **SMD:** "Archer Tower, helicopter SMD, PKR A015, recieved Golf, inbound central pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "SMD, Archer Tower, report Logan Motorway"  
    **SMD:** "Report Logan Motorway, SMD"  

    **SMD:** "SMD, Logan Motorway"  
    **AF ADC:** "SMD, track direct central pad, cross 10L and 10R"  
    **SMD:** "Track direct central pad, crossing 10L and 10R, SMD"

## ATIS
### Runway Nomination

| Priority | Runway Mode |
| ------ | ------ |
| =1     | 10L & 10R |
| =1     | 28L & 28R |
| =2     | 04L & 04R |
| =2     | 22L & 22R |
| 3      | Any Single Runway Operations |

The ATIS must indicate the current runway config and nominate what each runway is being used for. This should be reflected on the ATIS as below:

| Runway | RWY Field  |
| ----------------| --------- |
| Single RWY      | `ALL OPERATIONS RWY (Number)` |
| RWY 10/28       | `RWY 10L/28R FOR ARRS AND DEPS NORTH. RWY 10R/28L FOR ARRS AND DEPS SOUTH` |
| RWY 04          | `RWY 04L FOR ARRS AND DEPS NORTH AND WEST. RWY 04R FOR ARRS AND DEPS SOUTH AND EAST` |
| RWY 22          | `RWY 22. EASTERN DEPS NAVBL. RWY 22R FOR ARRS AND DEPS NORTH AND WEST. RWY 22L FOR ARRS SOUTH AND EAST AND DEPS SOUTH` |

#### Dual ADC Operations

| Runway | RWY Field  |
| ----------------| --------- |
| RWY 10/28       | `RWY 10L/28R FOR ARRS AND DEPS NORTH, FREQ 123.6. RWY 10R/28L FOR ARRS AND DEPS SOUTH, FREQ 118.1` |
| RWY 04          | `RWY 04L FOR ARRS AND DEPS NORTH AND WEST, FREQ 123.6. RWY 04R FOR ARRS AND DEPS SOUTH AND EAST, FREQ 118.1` |
| RWY 22          | `EASTERN DEPS NAVBL. RWY 22R FOR ARRS AND DEPS NORTH AND WEST, FREQ 123.6. RWY 22L FOR ARRS SOUTH AND EAST AND DEPS SOUTH, FREQ 118.1` |

### Approach Expectation
The APCH field should include `EXP INST APCH` when:   
  - the ceiling is at or below `A029`; or  
  - visibility is less than 5000m  

### Helicopter Area
The ATIS must indicate the current active helicopter area, refer to [Training Areas](#training-areas).

!!! example  
    OPR INFO: **HELICOPTER AREA A ACTIVE**  

## Coordination
### Departures
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from AF ADC to BN TCU for all aircraft **entering BN TCU CTA**.

The Standard Assignable level from **AF ADC** to **BN TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------- | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A040` and `RFL` |

### Arrivals/Overfliers
BN TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to AF ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to AF ADC, unless AF ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **AF ADC**</span>: "via TVT for the visual approach, UJE"  
    <span class="hotline">**AF ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "UJE, visual approach"

!!! tip
    Remember that IFR aircraft are only separated from other IFR or SVFR aircraft in class D. You should *generally* be able to issue a clearance for an approach and use other separation methods (visual separation, holding a departure on the ground) if separation is required with these aircraft.

#### ADC North Online
When ADC North is online, BN TCU may not be familiar with which controller owns what airspace. Best practice is to receive the coordination no matter what, and if it was meant for the other ADC controller, relay the coordination to them internally.

### AF ADC Internal
AF ADC must heads-up coordinate **all aircraft** transiting from one ADC controller to the other.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**AF ADC S** -> **AF ADC N**</span>: "via TAR, TQC for an overhead join"  
    <span class="hotline">**AF ADC N** -> **AF ADC S**</span>: "TQC, A015"
