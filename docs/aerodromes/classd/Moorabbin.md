## Coordination
### Departures
Departures in to ML TCU Class C airspace require a "Next" call, where ML TCU will provide the cleared level. There is no standard assignable level.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MB ADC** -> **MDS**</span>: "Next, SGE"  
    <span class="hotline">**MDS** -> **MB ADC**</span>: "SGE, A060"  
    <span class="hotline">**MB ADC** -> **MDS**</span>: "A060, SGE"

Departing aircraft will be **cleared to leave and re-enter controlled airspace** on climb to their assigned level, due to the structure of the Class C airspace around YMMB.

!!! example
    **MB ADC**: "SGE, Cleared to leave and re-enter controlled airspace climbing to A060, no reported IFR traffic. Contact Melbourne Departures on 129.4"  
    **SGE**: "Cleared to leave and re-enter controlled airspace climbing to A060, Departures 129.4, SGE"

### Arrivals/Overfliers
ML TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to MB ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to MB ADC, unless MB ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft will not be coordinated, and will need to receive their airways clearance from MB ADC.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MDS** -> **MB ADC**</span>: "To the west, PLE, for the NDB-A"  
    <span class="hotline">**MB ADC** -> **MDS**</span>: "PLE, NDB-A"

!!! tip
    Remember that IFR aircraft are only separated from other IFR or SVFR aircraft in class D. Use other separation methods, such as holding a departure on the ground, if separation is required with these aircraft.
