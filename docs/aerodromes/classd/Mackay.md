Refer to [Class D Tower Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/classd) for more information.

## Coordination
### Departures
#### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required to MKA for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MK ADC** -> **MKA**</span>: "Next, ABC, runway 14"  
    <span class="hotline">**MKA** -> **MK ADC**</span>: "ABC, Heading 150 Visual, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**MK ADC** -> **MKA**</span>: "Heading 150 Visual unrestricted, ABC"

The TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **MKA**.

The Standard Assignable level from MKADC to MKA is the lower of `A060` or the `RFL`.

#### SMC
The controller assuming responsibility of **SMC** shall give heads-up coordination to **MKA** prior to the issue of the following clearances:  

- VFR Departures  
- Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS

### Arrivals/Overfliers
MKA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to MK ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to MK ADC, unless MK ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MKA** -> **MK ADC**</span>: "Via BAVAM for the RNP RWY 32, VOZ1164‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**MK ADC** -> **MKA**</span>: "VOZ1164, RNP RWY 32"
