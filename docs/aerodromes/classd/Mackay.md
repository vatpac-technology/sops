## Coordination
### Departures
#### Auto Release
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required to MKA for aircraft that are:   

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID; or  
- Not entering MKA CTA

The Standard Assignable level from **MK ADC** to **MKA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------ | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A060` and `RFL` |

#### SMC
The controller assuming responsibility of **SMC** shall give [heads-up](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#airways-clearance) coordination to **MKA** prior to the issue of the following clearances:  

- VFR departures entering MKA CTA
- Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS

### Arrivals/Overfliers
MKA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to MK ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to MK ADC, unless MK ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.
