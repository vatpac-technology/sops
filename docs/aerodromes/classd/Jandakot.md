!!! abstract "Non-Standard Positions"
    :material-information-outline: Non-standard positions may only be used in accordance with [VATPAC Air Traffic Services Policy](https://vatpac.org/publications/policies){target=new}.  
    Approval must be sought from the **bolded parent position** prior to opening a Non-Standard Position, unless [NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} indicate otherwise (eg, for events).

### Dual ADC Operations
When Jandakot ADC East is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC West takes responsibility for the North-West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **06L/24R**).

ADC East takes responsibility for the South-East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **06R/24L**).

ADC East is **not permitted** online when *Single Runway* Operations are in use.

Refer to the [ATIS section](#runway-nomination) for information on ATIS formatting when ADC East is online.

## Airspace
JT ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the JT CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

### Dual ADC Operations
Airspace Ownership when ADC East is online, is split down the middle of the **06L/24R** and **06R/24L** extended centrelines.

## VFR Operations
### Arrivals
VFR aircraft will report inbound at BOAT, POWR, OAKF or RUSS at `A015`. JT ADC will instruct aircraft to maintain `A015` or remain outside the control zone (workload permitting). Aircraft will then report again at ADWD when inbound from BOAT or POWR, or FDL when inbound from OAKF or RUSS. They should then be instructed to join the circuit as below:

| VFR Approach Point | RWYs 06  | RWYs 24 | RWY 12 | RWY 30 |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ADWD   | *"Join base runway 06L"* | *"Join right downwind runway 24R, maintain A015"*, until the aircraft are clear of RWY 24R departures via *Fiona Stanley Hospital* and FREM, then *"Cleared Visual Approach"*  | *"Join final runway 12"* | *"Join downwind ruwnay 30, maintain A015"*, until the aircraft is clear of RWY 30 departures via YGB, then *"Cleared Visual Approach"* |
| FDL  | *"Join downwind runway 06L, maintain A015"*. Aircraft should fly overhead the airfield between the control tower and the upwind end of the runway and join the circuit. Once established in the circuit, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join right downwind runway 24R, maintain A015"*. Aircraft should fly overhead the airfield between the control tower and the upwind end of the runway and join the circuit. Once established in the circuit, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join right downwind runway 12"* | *"Join final runway 30"* |

All aircraft will arrive on runway 06L/24R or 12/30.

!!! note
    Circuit joining instructions given without an assigned altitude imply clearance to conduct the visual approach. There is no need to clear these aircraft for a visual approach.

### Departures
VFR aircraft should report ready to **JT ADC** with their departure intentions.  A takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to depart the zone by extending the pilot's requested leg of the circuit.  Aircraft departing the zone into class G airspace will transfer to area frequency upon leaving the zone, **no explicit frequency transfer is given to these aircraft**.

Aircraft departing a leg of the circuit will climb to and maintain the following levels until clear of the zone:  
All runways: `A010`  

VFR aircraft will depart via set outbound departure routes. Aircraft will track extended circuit legs to the departure point. These departure points include: YGB, FREM via *Fiona Stanley Hospital*, and SHOP.

Departures via FREM and YGB will depart on runway 06L/24R. Runway 06R/24L is used for circuit traffic and departures via SHOP.

## IFR Operations
### Arrivals
**PH TCU** will coordinate all IFR arrivals in accordance with coordination procedures.

### Departures
All IFR Departures must be assigned the most appropriate SID in accordance with the aircraft's direction of flight.

| Direction | SID   |
| -------| ----- |
| South/West    | TONEG  |
| North/North-west    | ISPET |
| East/North-east    | SCARP |

## Circuits
The circuit direction changes depending on tower opening hours and runway being used.

| Runway | Direction  |
| -------| ----- |
| 06L    | Left  |
| 06R    | Right |
| 24L    | Left  |
| 24R    | Right |
| 12     | Left  |
| 30     | Left  |

Circuits to be flown at `A010`

## Helicopter Operations
### General
Unless otherwise depicted in the `ERSA FAC YPJT`, all helicopters must comply with fixed wing procedures.

### Circuits
Circuits are conducted within the lateral confines of the fixed-wing circuit at `A008`, in the same direction as the current runway config.  The termination point of the circuit is the Main Pad.

## ATIS
### Runway Nomination
The ATIS must indicate the current runway config and nominate what each parallel runway is being used for. The northern runway (**06L/24R**) is primarily used for VFR arrivals and departures, the southern runway (**06R/24L**) for circuit training and departures via `SHOP`. The cross runway (**12/30**) for all arrivals/departures when weather is unsuitable for parallel runway operations.  

This should be reflected on the ATIS as below:  

- Single ADC: `RWY 06R/24L FOR CCTS AND DEPS VIA ARMADALE SHOPS. RWY 06L/24R FOR ARRS AND ALL OTHER DEPS`  
- Dual ADC: `RWY 06R/24L FOR CCTS AND DEPS VIA ARMADALE SHOPS, FREQ 119.4. RWY 06L/24R FOR ARRS AND ALL OTHER DEPS, FREQ 118.1`  

### Operational Info
When PH RWY 03 is in operation, the ATIS OPR INFO shall include:
`DUE YPPH DUTY RWY 03, CAUTION WAKE TURB`

## Coordination
### Departures
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from JT ADC to PH TCU for all aircraft **entering PH TCU CTA**. 

The Standard Assignable level from **JT ADC** to **PH TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------ | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A030` and `RFL` |

### Arrivals/Overfliers
PH TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to JT ADC.  
IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to JT ADC, unless JT ADC nominates a restriction.  
VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**PH TCU** -> **JT ADC**</span>: "via RNAV-Z RWY 06L, FD416, circling to land RWY 24R"  
    <span class="hotline">**JT ADC** -> **PH TCU**</span>: "FD416, RNAV-Z RWY 06L with a circle to land RWY 24R"  

!!! tip
    Remember that IFR aircraft are only separated from other IFR or SVFR aircraft in class D.  You should *generally* be able to issue a clearance for an approach and use other separation methods (visual separation, holding a departure on the ground) if separation is required with these aircraft.

#### ADC East Online
When ADC East is online, PH TCU may not be familiar with which controller owns what airspace. Best practice is to receive the coordination no matter what, and if it was meant for the other ADC controller, relay the coordination to them internally.

### JT ADC Internal
JT ADC must heads-up coordinate **all aircraft** transiting from one ADC controller to the other.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**JT ADC E** -> **JT ADC W**</span>: "via FDL, TBN for an overfly"  
    <span class="hotline">**JT ADC W** -> **JT ADC E**</span>: "TBN, A015"
