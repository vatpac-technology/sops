## Airspace
TN ADC owns the Class C airspace **in the TN CTR** within 10nm of the YPTN ARP from `SFC` to `A025`. This airspace is primarily used for military circuits and initial and pitch approaches.

### SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **DN**, **LAREB**, **GREGA**, **DOSAM**, **MILIV**, **MIGAX**, **DAPMA** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint.
Aircraft who are not planned via those points or who are negative RNAV may be assigned a RADAR SID or a visual departure.

#### Gate Departures (All Military Aircraft)
There are 11 gates to facilate departues and arrivals from the TN Training Airspace, based on the TN TACAN. Aircraft can be cleared to track direct to the gate, or allow them to intercept the outbound radial by 10 DME. 

| Gate Name | Ident | Bearing (Â°M) | Distance (nm) | Restricted Area |
| ------ | ----------| ----------| ----------| ----------|
| BIAK     | BIA | 320 | 30 | N/A |
| TOP GATE     | TOP | 300 | 30 | R225D |
| MOROTAI     | MOR | 270 | 30 | R225D |
| TADJI     | TAD | 240 | 30 | R225D |
| TARAKAN     | TAR | 200 | 30 | R225D |
| BOTTOM GATE     | BOM | 190 | 30 | R225D |
| NADZAB     | NAD | 150 | 30 | N/A |
| MILNE     | MIL | 090 | 30 | R226A |
| WEDGE 1     | W1 | 285 | 16 | R238 |
| WEDGE 2     | W2 | 260 | 12 | R238 |
| WEDGE 3     | W3 | 200 | 16 | R238 |

!!! phraseology 
    CLAS35 plans to enter the R225 area via the MOROTAI Gate for Military Training.  
    **TN ACD**: "CLAS35, cleared to YPTN via MOROTAI, flight planned route. Runway 14, Intercept the outbound radial by 10 DME. Climb to F190. Squawk 6001, Departure Frequency 120.95"   

Since the Gate Departures are not SIDs, TN ACD needs to write the name of the coded departure in the *Global Ops Field* of the Strip, and amend the flight plan route to include all relevant tracking points.

Place/Bearing Distance points in the FDR can be used for this, with **TN** as the reference point, in the format PPPPBBBDDD.

!!! example 
    MOROTAI = TN170030  
    NADZAB = TN150030  

## Miscellaneous
### Circuit Operations
The Circuit Area Airspace is allocated to be within 5nm of the YPTN ARP from `SFC` to `A025`. Aircraft can be instructed to extend outside of this airspace by ATC for traffic management. 

!!! note
    If a Fast Jet is in the pattern, all other aircraft are required to be seperated by 1000ft as such the min circuit height becomes 2500ft when Fast Jet are in the pattern.

#### Circuit Direction
| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 14     | Right|
| 32     | Left |

### Intial and Pitch Operations 
The intial point is at 2000ft on the extended centerline of Taxiway Alpha at 6.5NM for RWY 14, 5NM for RWY 32. Aircraft will be cleared for a left, straight or right intial.

!!! phraseology
    **CLAS15**: "Request Intial and Pitch RWY 32"  
    **TN ADC**: "CLAS15, Cleared Straight Intial RWY 32, Report when at the Intial"  
    **CLAS15**: "On the Intial Point"  
    **TN ADC**: "CLAS15, descend to 1500ft, pitch at the Midfield"  
    **CLAS15**: "Wilco"

## Coordination
### TN TCU

'Next' coordination is required from TN ADC to TN TCU for all aircraft.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**TN ADC** -> **TN TCU**</span>: "Next, ASY01, runway 32"  
    <span class="hotline">**TN TCU** -> **TN ADC**</span>: "ASY01, Assigned Heading Right 030, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**TN ADC** -> **TN TCU**</span>: "Assigned Heading Heading Right 030, ASY01"
