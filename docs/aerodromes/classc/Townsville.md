!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**TL ADC** -> **TL TCU**</span>: "Next, DNGO05, runway 19"  
    <span class="hotline">**TL TCU** -> **TL ADC**</span>: "DNGO05, Assigned Heading Left 150, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**TL ADC** -> **TL TCU**</span>: "Assigned Heading Left 150, DNGO05"  

The Standard Assignable level from TL ADC to TL TCU is the lower of `F180` or the RFL.
