## Airspace
BN ADC is not responsible for any airspace by default.

## Maneuvering Area Responsibility
There are three SMC positions at Brisbane which are responsible for various parts of the maneuvering area, as shown below.

## Standard Taxi Routes
Taxiway A is to be used in the same direction as the duty runway. Taxiway B is to be used in the opposite direction to the duty runway.

Taxiway Y is to be used in a westerly direction and Taxiway Z in an easterly direction.

!!! tip
    Aircraft vacating runway 19R may conflict with aircraft taxiing outbound via taxiway Yankee as they turn onto taxiway Sierra. Consider instructing departing aircraft to hold short of Sierra until the conflict can be resolved.  
    
    A similar conflict may exist between aircraft taxiing inbound via taxiway Zulu and aircraft taxiing outbound for runway 19L. Consider instructing inbound aircraft to hold short of taxiway Y1, allowing the use of Y1 and Charlie in case of a queue for holding point A3.

### SMC Frequency Change Instructions
To minimise conflict in the next SMC area of responsibility, aircraft should be instructed to hold short of predetermined taxiways and instructed to contact the next SMC controller (for international aircraft or less-experienced pilots) or allowed to transfer to the next frequency independently (for domestic aircraft).

| Originating SMC | Receiving SMC  | Taxi Instruction |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| SMC Domestic | SMC North | Hold short W |
| SMC North | SMC Domestic | Hold short B4 |
| SMC Domestic | SMC South | Hold short B7 |
| SMC South | SMC Domestic | Hold short B6 |

When aircraft wish to cross runway 01R/19L and taxi to/from eastern General Aviation Maintenance Area via taxiway H3, they should be instructed to hold short of the runway and contact the next SMC.

## Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals  | Departures |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 1 - SODPROPS    | 19R       | 01R        |
| 2 - 19 PROPS    | 19L & 19R | 19L & 19R  |
| 3 - 01 PROPS    | 01L & 01R | 01L & 01R  |

!!! note
    The SODPROPS mode is most suitable for Noise Abatement. The PROPS modes are most suitable for higher capacity. Since for the most part, neither of these are a factor on VATSIM, it is up to you which runway mode you would like to operate, subject to winds. Consider favouring the higher capacity PROPS modes during busy times, such as events like Panic Stations.

When using the SODPROPS mode, pass traffic information to aircraft that are departing and landing at the same time

!!! example
    **BN ADC:** "ABC, Traffic is DEF, a 737, on short final for the opposite direction parallel runway. Runway 01R, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    **ABC:** "Cleared for Takeoff Runway 01R, ABC"  
    **BN ADC:** "DEF, Traffic is ABC, an A320, departing from the opposite direction parallel runway to the South-West. Runway 19R, Cleared to Land"  
    **DEF:** "Cleared to Land Runway 19R, DEF"  

## Parallel Runway Operations
Refer to [Parallel Runway Separation Standards](../../../separation-standards/parallelapps) for more information

### Runway Selection
Aircraft shall be assigned the following runways for departure when PROPS are in progress:

| Aircraft tracking | Runway  |
| ----------------| --------- |
| via BIXAD   | 01L/19R     |
| via GUMKI | 01R/19L |
| via SCOTT | 01R/19L |
| via SANEG | 01R/19L |
| via WACKO | 01L/19R |
| Other aircraft: |
| To the NORTH and WEST | 01L/19R |
| To the SOUTH and EAST | 01R/19L |

!!! tip
    Runway 01L/19R opened in 2020. Some pilots on VATSIM may have old simulators/scenery, in which case they will only have Runway 01R/19L available. Endeavour to be accommodating of pilots' requests in this instance.

### SID Selection
Jet Aircraft planned via **BIXAD**, **GUMKI**, **SCOTT**, **SANEG**, or **WACKO**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

!!! example
    Jet Aircraft planned via SCOTT, assigned runway 19L, shall be assigned the SCOTT SID.

Non-Jet aircraft, and aircraft that cannot accept a Procedural SID, shall be assigned the **Radar SID**.

!!! example
    Non-Jet Aircraft planned via WACKO, assigned runway 01L, shall be assigned the BN (RADAR) SID.

#### SODPROPS
During the SODPROPS runway mode, Jet departures from Runway 01R shall be assigned the **ASISO** Procedural SID in lieu of other Procedural SIDs available that terminate at the appropriate waypoint.

!!! example
    Jet Aircraft planned via SCOTT, assigned runway 01R, shall be assigned the ASISO SID, SCOTT Transition.

## ATIS
#### Operational Info

When parallel runways are used for departures, the ATIS OPR INFO shall include:  
`INDEPENDENT PARALLEL DEPARTURES IN PROGRESS`  
When SODPROPS are in operation, the ATIS OPR INFO shall include:  
`SIMULTANEOUS OPPOSITE DIRECTION PARALLEL RUNWAY OPERATIONS IN PROGRESS`
#### Approach Types
The ATIS shall always have `EXP INST APCH` as the approach type. Visual Approaches are permitted on request, as long as a separation standard exists between the aircraft and any aircraft arriving on the parallel runway during PROPS, or departing from the parallel runway during SODPROPS.

## Coordination
### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required to BN TCU for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS (except during SODPROPS^); and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID  

^Auto Release is not available during SODPROPS runway mode. All aircraft must be coordinated from BN ADC to BN TCU.

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to BN TCU.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**BN ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "Next, QLK404D, Runway 19L"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN TCU** -> **BN ADC**</span>: "QLK404D, heading 160, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**BN ADC** -> **BN TCU**</span>: "Heading 160, QLK404D"   

    **BN ADC**: "QLK404D, Assigned heading Left 160, Runway 19L, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    **QLK404D**: "Left heading 160, Runway 19L, Cleared for Takeoff, QLK404D"

The BN TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **BN ADC**.

The Standard Assignable level from BN ADC to BN TCU is:  
For Jets: `A060`  
For Non-Jets: The lower of `A040` or the `RFL`

### Departures Controller
Refer to [Brisbane TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/brisbane/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **BDN** and/or **BDS** are online.
