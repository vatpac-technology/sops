## Runway Selection
Preferred runway is Runway 14 - all hours
The crosswind Runways 17/35 may be used at the same time as the main runways.

### Preferred RWY 14 Approach (All Hours) - Noise Abatement
The preferred approach for Jet aircraft above 5,700KG MTOW (unless due weather or critical operations requirements) is as follows:  
<ol><li>RNP W RWY 14</li><li>RNP Y RWY 14</li><li>RNP Z RWY 14</li><li>VISUAL APCH RWY 14</li><li>ILS RWY 14</li></ol>

### Circuit Direction
Circuits are to be conducted at `A010`.  

| Runway               | Direction       |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 14 | Left  |
| 32 | Right  |
| 17 | Left | 
| 35 | Right    | 

## VFR Procedures
VFR aircraft often transit the CG CTR via the coast. This conflicts with arrivals and departures to both runway 14 and 32, and should be accommodated where traffic permits. During busy traffic periods, transit aircraft shall be cleared via the [Western VFR Route](#western-vfr-route). 

### Arrivals
#### From the North
Aircraft approaching from the north will generally contact ADC at Q1 or ROT for clearance. They should be instructed to track coastal southbound, then join final runway 14 or downwind runway 32.

!!! phraseology
    **OMU:** "Gold Coast Tower, Cessna 172 OMU, abeam Q1, recieved F, inbound, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "OMU, Gold Coast Tower, cleared overwater southbound, not above A015"  
    **OMU:** "Cleared overwater southbound, not above A015, OMU"

    **CG ADC:** "OMU, track for final runway 14, cleared visual approach"  
    **OMU:** "Track for final runway 14, cleared visual approach, OMU"

Where insufficient spacing exists with IFR aircraft, instruct VFR aircraft to expect a clearance via ROTC, which will offset them from the extended runway centreline. 

!!! note
    The Class C lower limit overhead ROTC is `A015`.

!!! phraseology
    **BTA:** "Gold Coast Tower, Sling BTA, abeam Q1, inbound, received P, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "BTA, Gold Coast Tower, remain outside controlled airspace, expect a clearance tracking via ROTC, report approaching ROTC."  
    **BTA:** "Remain outside controlled airspace, wilco, BTA"  

    **CG ADC:** "BTA, traffic is an A320, 1 mile north of BLGH, report sighting and able to maintain own separation"  
    **BTA:** "Traffic in sight, we're able to maintain own separation, BTA"  
    **CG ADC:** "BTA, follow the A320, maintain own separation, track for final runway 14, cleared visual approach"  
    **BTA:** "Follow the A320, maintain own separation, track for final runway 14, cleared visual approach BTA"  

#### From the South
Aircraft approaching from the south will generally contact ADC approaching HASS for clearance. They should be instructed to join the circuit for the duty runway.

!!! phraseology
    **FTQ:** "Gold Coast Tower, Cherokee FTQ, HASS, A015, inbound, received H, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "FTQ, Gold Coast Tower, join final runway 32, cleared visual approach"  
    **FTQ:** "Join final runway 32, cleared visual approach, FTQ"

Where insufficient spacing exists with IFR aircraft, instruct VFR aircraft to remain OCTA and report again at CGD (for runway 32) or to track northbound overwater with a clearance limit of CIS (for runway 14). Once clear of conflict, aircraft may join final for runway 32 or downwind/base for runway 14.

!!! phraseology
    **JCZ:** "Gold Coast Tower, Cessna 172 JCZ, HASS, A015, inbound, received M, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "JCZ, Gold Coast Tower, cleared overwater northbound, not above A015, clearance limit CIS"  
    **JCZ:** "Cleared overwater northbound, not above A015, clearance limit CIS, JCZ"

    **CG ADC:** "JCZ, cancel clearance limit, track coastal northbound, report DNGR"  
    **JCZ:** "Cancel clearance limit, track coastal northbound, JCZ"  

    **JCZ:** "JCZ, DNGR"  
    **CG ADC:** "JCZ, join left base runway 14, cleared visual approach"   
    **JCZ:** "Join left base runway 14, cleared visual approach, JCZ" 

!!! phraseology
    **LKU:** "Gold Coast Tower, Cherokee LKU, HASS, A015, inbound, received B, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "LKU, Gold Coast Tower, remain outside controlled airspace, report again at CGD"  
    **LKU:** "Remain OCTA, LKU"  

    **LKU:** "LKU, CDG"  
    **CG ADC:** "LKU, expect clearance in three minutes due inbound traffic, report sighting and able to maintain own separation with a 737, currently on a 12nm final runway 32"  
    **LKU:** "Wilco, LKU"  

    **LKU:** "LKU, traffic sighted, we can maintain own separation"  
    **CG ADC:** "LKU, follow the 737, maintain own separation, join final runway 32, cleared visual approach"  
    **LKU:** "Follow the 737, maintain own separation, join final runway 32, cleared visual approach, LKU"

### Low-Level Coastal Flights
Surf Lifesaving Patrol and Scenic Tour operations conducting low-level coastal flights within the CG CTR shall be cleared overwater in the required direction of travel, not above `A002`.

!!! phraseology
    **LIFE46:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter LIFE46, Q1, 3 POB, for low level coastal operations, received G, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "LIFE46, Gold Coast Tower, cleared overwater southbound, not above A002"  
    **LIFE46:** "Cleared overwater southbound, not above A002, LIFE46"

### Western VFR Route
The Western VFR Route begins at NEN and tracks inland, terminating at Burringbar. It should generally be flown at `A015` (higher levels will require clearance from TCU). This route serves as an alternative route for aircraft wishing to transit through Gold Coast CTR and is laterally separated (by the 3nm radar standard) from both runway approach paths. Note that southern portion of the route is **not** laterally separated from the runway 14 departure paths.

!!! phraseology
    **WCS:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter WCS, NEN, A015, for Western VFR Route, received F, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "WCS, Gold Coast Tower, cleared Western VFR Route, not above A015, QNH 1013"  
    **WCS:** "Cleared Western VFR Route, not above A015, QNH 1013, WCS"  

    Once the aircraft exits the CTA, cancel their control services.

    **WCS:** "WCS, excited the zone"  
    **CG ADC:** "WCS, control services terminated, frequency change approved"   
    **WCS:** "Frequency change approved, WCS" 

!!! tip
    You can find details of the Western VFR Route on the [Gold Coast VTC](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp){target=new}.

## Helicopter Operations
Local helicopter operations are conducted on the Western Grass which is the area contained by blue gable markers north of the VOR and west of the runway intersection. This is marked on the aerodrome chart as “HELO OPS”.  
The HLS (Helipad) is located between the GA Apron and Taxiway Golf.  
Circuits from the Western Grass are to be made in the same direction as the duty runway.

### Hospital Helipads
Within the Gold Coast CTR, there are two main hospital helipads. Tweed Heads Hospital (YTWH), and Tweed Valley Hospital (YXTV).

#### Arrivals
ADC shall assess the current traffic situation and, if necessary, instruct the pilot to hold and/or maintain own separation with any arriving or departing aircraft, then clear them for a visual approach to their inbound hospital.

!!! phraseology
    **WP1:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter WP1, 6 miles south, inbound YXTV, recieved G"  
    **CG ADC:** "WP1, Gold Coast Tower, cleared to YXTV direct, not above A015"  
    **WP1:** "Cleared to YXTV direct, not above A015, WP1"  

Both hospital helipads are outside the maneuvering area and do not require a landing clearance from CG ADC. Helicopters arriving to these helipads should be instructed to "report on the ground" so the controller knows when they are no longer active in their airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **CG ADC:** "WP1, cleared visual approach YXTV, report on the ground"  
    **WP1:** "Cleared visual approach YXTV, wilco, WP1"  

#### Departures
Aircraft departing from hospitals within the Gold Coast CTR must obtain clearance prior to becoming airborne. The Tweed Valley Hospital (YXTV) helipad, is located 6nm south beneath Runway 32 extended centerline, and may present potential traffic conflicts. Aircraft will be subject to delays depending on traffic in the Gold Coast CTR.

Both hospital helipads are outside the maneuvering area and do not require a takeoff clearance from CG ADC, however a clearance to become airborne is required. Helicopters departing from these helipads should be instructed to "report airborne".

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU588:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter RSCU588, YXTV, ready for northen departure"  
    **CG ADC:** "RSCU588, Gold Coast Tower, remain on the ground, expect clearance in 3 minutes due traffic"  
    **RSCU588:** "Remain on the ground, RSCU588"

    **CG ADC:** "RSCU588, Cleared to YBBN via STOT, flight planned route. Not above A015, report airborne"  
    **RSCU588:** "Cleared to YBBN via STOT, flight planned route. Not above A015, wilco, RSCU588"  

## Coordination
### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required to BN TCU for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to CG TCU.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**CG ADC** -> **BAC**</span>: "Next, CBN, runway 14"  
    <span class="hotline">**BAC** -> **CG ADC**</span>: "CBN, heading 030, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CG ADC** -> **BAC**</span>: "Heading 030, CBN"  

    **CG ADC**: "CBN, Assigned heading left 030, Runway 14, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    **CBN**: "Left heading 030, Runway 14, Cleared for Takeoff, CBN"

The BN TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **CG ADC**.

The Standard Assignable level from CG ADC to BN TCU is:  
For Jets: `A060`  
For Non-Jets: The lower of `A060` or the `RFL`

### Start Clearance
A start clearance is required for aircraft planned to YBBN. Start clearance must be coordinated with BN TCU.
