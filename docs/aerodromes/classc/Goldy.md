## Runway Selection
Preferred runway is Runway 14 - all hours
The crosswind Runways 17/35 may be used at the same time as the main runways.

### Preferred RWY 14 Approach (All Hours) - Noise Abatement
The preferred approach for Jet aircraft above 5,700KG MTOW (unless due weather or critical operations requirements) is as follows:  
<ol><li>RNP W RWY 14</li><li>RNP Y RWY 14</li><li>RNP Z RWY 14</li><li>VISUAL APCH RWY 14</li><li>ILS RWY 14</li></ol>

### Circuit Direction
Circuits are to be conducted at `A010`.  

| Runway               | Direction       |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 14 | Left  |
| 32 | Right  |
| 17 | Left | 
| 35 | Right    | 

## VFR Procedures

Aircraft transiting the Gold Coast CTR will be subject to delays depending on traffic in the Gold Coast CTR. Aircraft transiting shall be cleared overwater north/southbound not above `A015`, or during busy traffic periods cleared via the [Western VFR Route](#western-vfr-route). 

### Arrivals
Aircraft tracking southbound should contact ADC at Q1, or Robina Town Centre (ROT) for clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **OMU:** "Gold Coast Tower, OMU, abeam Q1, recieved F, inbound fullstop, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "OMU, Gold Coast Tower, cleared overwater southbound, not above A015"  
    **OMU:** "Cleared overwater southbound, not above A015, OMU"

Alternatively, if jet aircraft are inbound at the same time and not enough spacing exists, aircraft inbound via Q1 should be cleared via amended Robina Town Centre for shorter delays, or "clearance not available, remain outside class Charlie airspace" when delays are expected to be extensive.

!!! phraseology
    **BTA:** "Gold Coast Tower, BTA, abeam Q1, recieved C, inbound fullstop, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "BTA, Gold Coast Tower, cleared amended ROT, Gold Coast, maintain A015"  
    **BTA:** "Cleared amended ROT, Gold Coast, maintain A015, BTA"  

    **CG ADC:** "BTA, traffic is a A320, 1 mile north of BLGH, report sighting"  
    **BTA:** "Traffic in sight, BTA"  
    **CG ADC:** "BTA, maneuver to the follow the A320, cleared visual approach runway 14"  
    **BTA:** "Maneuver to follow the A320, cleared visual approach runway 14, BTA"  

Aircraft tracking northbound should contact ADC approaching Hastings Point (HASS) for clearance. 

!!! phraseology
    **JCZ:** "Gold Coast Tower, JCZ, HASS, A015, inbound fullstop, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "JCZ, Gold Coast Tower, cleared overwater northbound, not above A015, clearance limit CIS"  
    **JCZ:** "Cleared overwater northbound, not above A015, clearance limit CIS, JCZ"

    **CG ADC:** "JCZ, cancel clearance limit, report DNGR"  
    **JCZ:** "Cancel clearance limit, report DNGR, JCZ"  

    **JCZ:** "JCZ, DNGR"  
    **CG ADC:** "JCZ, from DNGR, cleared visual approach, left base runway 14"   
    **JCZ:** "From DNGR, cleared visual approach, left base runway 14, JCZ"  

### Departures

Aircraft leaving the Gold Coast CTR shall have their control services terminated and have any important traffic information passed along.

!!! phraseology
    *NWZ is shortly leaving CTA tracking via Robina Town Centre*  
    **CG ADC:** "NWZ, control services terminated, frequency change approved"   
    **NWZ:** "Frequency change approved, NWZ"  

### Coastal Flights
Surf Lifesaving Patrol and Scenic Tour operations conducting low-level coastal flights within the CG CTR shall be cleared overwater in the required direction of travel, not above `A002`.

!!! phraseology
    **LIFE46:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter LIFE46, Q1, 3 POB, request clearance"  
    **CG ADC:** "LIFE46, Gold Coast Tower, cleared overwater southbound, not above A002"  
    **LIFE46:** "Cleared overwater southbound, not above A002, LIFE46"

### Western VFR Route
The Western VFR Route begins at Nerang and tracks inland, terminating at Burringbar. Aircraft following this route exit CTA at Stotts Island, where control services are terminated. This route serves as an alternative route for aircraft wishing to transit through Gold Coast CTR. Prior to entering the CTA, pilots must obtain clearance for the Western VFR Route.

!!! phraseology
    **WCS:** "Gold Coast Tower, WCS, overhead NEN, request Western VFR Route"  
    **CG ADC:** "WCS, Gold Coast Tower, cleared Western VFR Route, not above A015, QNH 1013"  
    **WCS:** "Cleared Western VFR Route, not above A015, QNH 1013, WCS"  

    Once the aircraft exits the CTA, cancel their control services.

    **WCS:** "WCS, excited the zone"  
    **CG ADC:** "WCS, control services terminated, frequency change approved"   
    **WCS:** "Frequency change approved, WCS" 

!!! tip
    You can find details of the Western VFR Route in the [Gold Coast VTC](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp){target=new}.

 


## Helicopter Operations
Local helicopter operations are conducted on the Western Grass which is the area contained by blue gable markers north of the VOR and west of the runway intersection. This is marked on the aerodrome chart as “HELO OPS”.  
The HLS (Helipad) is located between the GA Apron and Taxiway Golf.  
Circuits from the Western Grass are to be made in the same direction as the duty runway.

### Hospital Helipads
Within the Gold Coast CTR, there are two main hospital helipads. Tweed Heads Hospital (YTWH), and Tweed Valley Hospital (YXTV).

#### Arrivals

ADC shall assess the current traffic situation and, if necessary, instruct the pilot to hold and/or maintain own separation with any arriving or departing aircraft, then clear them for a visual approach to their inbound hospital.

!!! phraseology
    **WP1:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter WP1, 6 miles south, inbound Tweed Valley Hospital, recieved G"  
    **CG ADC:** "WP1, Gold Coast Tower, track direct Tweed Valley Hospital not above A015"  
    **WP1:** "Track direct Tweed Valley Hospital not above A015, WP1"  

Both hospital helipads are outside the maneuvering area and do not require a landing clearance from CG ADC. Helicopters arriving to these helipads should be instructed to "report on the ground" so the controller knows when they are no longer active in their airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **CG ADC:** "WP1, cleared visual approach Tweed Valley Hospital, report on the ground"  
    **WP1:** "Cleared visual approach Tweed Valley Hospital, report on the ground, WP1"  

#### Departures

Aircraft departing from hospitals within the Gold Coast CTR must obtain clearance prior to becoming airborne. The Tweed Valley Hospital (YXTV) helipad, is located 6nm south beneath Runway 32 extended centerline, and may presents potential traffic conflicts. Aircraft will be subject to delays depending on traffic in the Gold Coast CTR.

Both hospital helipads are outside the maneuvering area and do not require a takeoff clearance from GC ADC, however a clearance to become airborne is required. Helicopters departing from these helipads should be instructed to "report airborne".

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU588:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter RSCU588, Tweed Valley Hospital, ready for northen departure"  
    **CG ADC:** "RSCU588, Gold Coast Tower, remain on the ground, expect clearance in 3 minutes due traffic"  
    **RSCU588:** "Remain on the ground, RSCU588"

    **CG ADC:** "RSCU533, track direct STOT, not above A015, report airborne"  
    **RSCU533:** "Track direct STOT, not above A015 report airborne, RSCU533"  


## Coordination
### Auto Release
'Next' coordination is **not** required to BN TCU for aircraft that are:   
  a) Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  b) Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  c) Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to CG TCU.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**CG ADC** -> **BAC**</span>: "Next, CBN, runway 14"  
    <span class="hotline">**BAC** -> **CG ADC**</span>: "CBN, heading 030, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**CG ADC** -> **BAC**</span>: "Heading 030, CBN"  

    **CG ADC**: "CBN, Assigned heading left 030, Runway 14, Cleared for Takeoff"  
    **CBN**: "Left heading 030, Runway 14, Cleared for Takeoff, CBN"

The BN TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, with the concurrence of **CG ADC**.

The Standard Assignable level from CG ADC to BN TCU is:  
For Jets: `A060`  
For Non-Jets: The lower of `A060` or the `RFL`

### Start Clearance
A start clearance is required for aircraft planned to YBBN. Start clearance must be coordinated with BN TCU.
