## Airspace
ADC owns the airspace within the DN CTR (`SFC`–`A010`). This airspace is designed to facilitate the processing of helicopter scenic flights and low-level helicopter circuits.  
The CTR extends 7NM from the thresholds of runways 11 and 29 but does not including the Robertson Barracks transit zone.  

ADC may request DN TCU (`SFC`–`A020`) from DN TCU to facilitate fixed-wing circuit operations:  
a) Fixed-wing circuit operations are typically conducted at Delissaville (YDLV) due to high traffic density at Darwin  
b) ADC may deny requests for circuits if IFR traffic may be unduly delayed

## Standard Taxi Routes
Aircraft transiting to or from the Southern and Northern GA should follow the following standardised taxi routes:  
a) Outbound via V1  
b) Inbound via Y1  

Traffic permitting, aircraft above 136,000kg MTOW shall be entered/exited for RWY 11/29 from taxiways B2, C3, D or E2 and backtracked as required.  

Taxiway V has a passing bay, located adjacent to the ARFF section. The passing bay is the preferred location for engine run-ups, no longer than 3 minutes  

## Runway Modes
Runway selection shall be coordinated by DN ADC. In any case, a change of runway mode shall not be broadcast on the ATIS until DAW accepts the change.  

The Runway Mode options available are:

a) Runway 29 and Runway 36;  
b) Runway 29 and Runway 18;  
c) Runway 29 only;  
d) Runway 11 and Runway 36;  
e) Runway 11 and Runway 18;  
f) Runway 11 only.  

## Non-RNAV Departures
For non-RNAV approved IFR aircraft with a wake turbulence category of medium or greater, issue a Radar SID  
For non-RNAV approved IFR aircraft with a wake turbulence category of light, issue a visual departure or Radar SID

## Miscellaneous
### Circuit Operations
VFR aircraft that will operate only in ADCs airspace shall be assigned SSR code 0100  

Circuit altitude will depend on the type of aircraft. Assign circuit altitudes for the following aircraft types:  

| Aircraft | Altitude |
| ----- | ---- |
| Military Jet | `A020` |
| Other Jet | `A015` |
| Non-Jet | `A010` |
| Helicopter | `A010` | 

### VFR Departures
VFR aircraft are required to track via one of the published VFR Routes (as shown on the Darwin VTC). VFR routes shall be assigned based on the destination radial from Darwin, as per below:  

|Outbound Radial |Assigned VFR Route|
|---|---|
|360 – 040 |VFR Route 1|
|041 – 084 |VFR Route 2|
|085 – 124 |VFR Route 3|
|125 – 180 |VFR Route 4|
|181 – 224 |VFR Route 5|
|225 – 359| Direct|

!!! tip
    If a VFR aircraft has not planned via a VFR route as above, use the phraseology: “*ABC, cleared amended route VFR route 1, climb to A020, squawk 4512*”

## Coordination
### DN TCU
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from DN ADC to DN TCU for all aircraft.

The Standard Assignable Level from  **DN ADC** to **DN TCU** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| IFR aircraft assigned a **Procedural** SID | The lower of `F180` and `RFL` |
| IFR aircraft **not** assigned a **Procedural** SID | The lower of `A030` and `RFL` |
| VFR aircraft | The lower of `A020` and `RFL` |
