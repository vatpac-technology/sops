## Airsapce
PE ADC owns the airspace within the Pearce CIRA (**5nm** Radius of YPEA ARP, located entirely within **R155A**) from `SFC` to `A035`. This airspace is primarily used for military circuits and initial and pitch approaches.

## Local Procedures 
### Initial and Pitch Procedures 

| Runway | Direction Initial | Inital Altitude
| ------ | ------------------|----------------|
| 05     | Any | A010 |
| 18L    | Left/Straight<br>Right | A015<br>A010 |
| 18R    | Left/Straight<br>Right | A015<br>A010 |
| 23     | Any | A015 |
| 36L    | Left<br>Right | A010<br>A015 |
| 36R    | Left<br>Right | A010<br>A015 |

## Runway Modes
### Circuits
Aircraft can be instructed to extend outside of this airspace by ATC for traffic management, following coordination with the appropriate sectors.

HAWKs have circuit altitude of `A016`, while both 2FTS and RSAF PC21s are assigned `A012`.

!!! note
    36L/18R is unsuitable for HAWK Aircraft

#### Circuit Direction

| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 05      | Left  |
| 18L    | Right |
| 18R    | Right |
| 23     | Right |
| 36L    | Left  |
| 36R    | Left  |

## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **GUNOK** shall be assigned the **GUNOK** SID. Aircraft planned via the **Wannamal Lane**, **Alkimos Lane**, or **Mullalloo Lane** shall be assigned relevant **Procedural SID**.

Aircraft **not** meeting that criteria, and **non-RNAV** aircraft shall be assigned either the RADAR SID or a visual departure. 

## Coordination
### PE TCU
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is required from PE ADC to PE TCU for all aircraft.

The Standard Assignable Level from **PE ADC** to **PE TCU** is:

| Departure Procedure | Level |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| **GUNOK** SID | `A030` |
| A **Procedural** SID | `F130` |
| All others | The lower of `F130` and `RFL` |
