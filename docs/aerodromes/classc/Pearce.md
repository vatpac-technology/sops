## Airsapce

PE ADC owns the Class C airspace **in the PE CTR** within 5nm of the YPEA ARP from `SFC` to `A035`. This airspace is primarily used for military circuits and initial and pitch approaches.

### SID Selection
vatSys does not have SIDs built-in for YPEA. Aircraft planned via **WAMAL**, **GUNOK**, **ALKIMOS**, **MULLALOO**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. as long as ATC is familiar with the chart, and the pilot is able. Aircraft who are not planned via those points or who are negative RNAV may be assigned a RADAR SID or a visual departure. 

!!! Note
  A Radar SID is preferred, however a Procedural SID may be issued on request. 

  Due to Civil Traffic Arriving from the North, the GUNOK SID will have an altitude assignment of A030.

  ### Level Assignment
The Standard Assignable Level from  **PE ADC** to **PE TCU** is:  
a) The Lower of `F130` or `RFL` for Aircraft assigned via Procedural or RNAV SID.  
b) `F130` for Aircraft assigned a Coded Departure.

## Miscellaneous

### Circuit Operations 
The Circuit Area Airspace is allocated to be within 5nm of the YPEA ARP from `SFC` to `A032`. Aircraft can be instructed to extend outside of this airspace by ATC for traffic management. Hawks have circuit altitude of A016 while both 2FTS and RSAF PC21s are assigned A012.

!!! Note
  36L/18R is unsuitable for HAWK Aircraft

## Coordination
### PE TCU

'Next' coordination is required from PE ADC to PE TCU for all aircraft.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**PE ADC** -> **PE TCU**</span>: "Next, ASY01, runway 36L"  
    <span class="hotline">**PE TCU** -> **PE ADC**</span>: "ASY01, Assigned Heading Right 030, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**PE ADC** -> **PE TCU**</span>: "Assigned Heading Heading Right 030, ASY01"
