!!! abstract "Non-Standard Positions"
    :material-information-outline: Non-standard positions may only be used in accordance with [VATPAC Air Traffic Services Policy](https://vatpac.org/publications/policies){target=new}.  
    Approval must be sought from the **bolded parent position** prior to opening a Non-Standard Position, unless [NOTAMs](https://vatpac.org/publications/notam){target=new} indicate otherwise (eg, for events).

## Airspace
PH ADC is not responsible for any airspace by default.

## Maneuvering Area Responsibility
The area of responsibility between SMC West and East is divided by Runway 03/21.  
Everything West of the Runway belongs to SMC West, everything East of the Runway belongs to SMC East.

## Runway Selection
### Southwest Plan
With the Southwest Plan active, all departures shall be assigned runway 21. Arrivals will be processed to either runway 21 or 24 based on their feeder fix, as per the table below:

| Feeder Fix | Assigned Runway |
| --- | --- |
| JULIM | 21 |
| SAPKO | 21 |
| IPMOR | 21 |
| KABLI | 24 (or 21 if operationally required) |
| LAVEX | 24 |
| SOLUS | 24 |

The ATIS shall notify `EXP ILS APCH`.

### Northeast Plan
With the Northeast Plan active, departures via `AVNEX`, `OTLED`, `OLMAM`, `SOLUS`, and `OPEGA` shall be assigned runway 03. All other departures shall be assigned runway 06. All arrivals will be processed to runway 03.

When both Runway 03 and Runway 06 are nominated as departure runways, broadcast the following: `RWY 03 FOR DEP VIA OTLED, AVNEX, OLMAM, SOLUS AND OPEGA. RWY 06 FOR ALL OTHER DEP.`

In the following conditions, ATIS shall notify `EXP ILS APCH`:  
    - By night; and/or  
    - Cloud base of `A032` or below

## Circuit Training
Circuit training traffic shall be issued SSR code and clearance to operate within circuit area not above `A015`. Circuit training is typically conducted on Runway 03/21.

All circuits are to be conducted to the east of Runway 03/21 (right-hand circuit Runway 03).

## Helicopter Operations
There are no helipad facilities at YPPH. Helicopters should be issued an airways clearance in accordance with the fixed-wing operation applicable to their flight rules (i.e. SID for IFR helicopters, VFR departure via appropriate VFR route if necessary for VFR helicopters). Helicopters should be cleared to takeoff/land from runways or taxiways, as deemed appropriate by ADC. The point of takeoff/landing must be specified by ADC.

!!! phraseology
    **PH ADC:** "YOE, taxiway Romeo, cleared to land"  

    **PH ADC:** "HWD, runway 21, cleared for takeoff"

## Scenic Flights
When traffic permits, VFR scenic flights over Perth are cleared via VICTOR 65 route (`CTE-PCTY-HKE`). Coordination with PH TCU is required prior to issuing this clearance, see [ACD to PH TCU](#acd-to-ph-tcu).

## Coordination
### Auto Release
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required for aircraft that are:   

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
- Assigned a **Procedural SID**

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to PH TCU.

The Standard Assignable level from PH ADC to PH TCU is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A050` and `RFL` |

### Departures Controller
Refer to [Perth TCU Airspace Division](../../../terminal/perth/#airspace-division) for information on airspace divisions when **PHD** is online.

### ACD to PH TCU
The controller assuming responsibility of ACD shall give [heads-up](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#airways-clearance) coordination to the relevant PH TCU controller prior to the issue of the following clearances:  

- VFR departures into PH TCU CTA
- Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS
