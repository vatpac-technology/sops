## Airspace

RIC ADC owns the Class C airspace **in the RIC CTR** within 10nm of the YSRI ARP from `SFC` to `A045`. This airspace is primarily used for military circuits and initial and pitch approaches, and airdrops.

## Charts
!!! note
    Additional charts to the AIP may be found in the RAAF TERMA document, available towards the bottom of [RAAF AIP Page](https://ais-af.airforce.gov.au/australian-aip){target=new}


## YSRI Aerodrome

### SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **ANKUB**, **KADOM** or **MUDGI** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Aircraft who are not planned via those points or who are negative RNAV may be assigned a RADAR SID or a visual departure.

### Runway Operations
Runways 10/28 is the primary runway at YSRI. 

## VFR Procedures
All aircraft outbound and inbound, or transiting the field maintain `A015`.  
Aircraft transiting the RIC CTR track via the northbound or southbound VFR route.  
Aircraft tracking northbound contact RIC ADC at Nepean Bridge (NPBR) for clearance.  
Aircraft tracking southbound contact RIC ADC at Kurmond (KRMD) for clearance.  

!!! tip
    You can find details of the transit route (including reporting points and altitudes) in the [`ERSA FAC YSRI`](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/current/ersa/FAC_YSRI_28NOV2024.pdf){target=new}.

### Training Areas
Richmond has 3 training areas surrounding the field used for  civil and military operations.

|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Londonderry Training Area| LDD TA        | `SFC - A015`        | Contained within R470             |
| Northern Training Area| NTA TA        | `SFC - A060`        | Contained within R470             |
| Southern Training Area| STA TA        | `SFC - A040`        | Contained within R470             |

## Miscellaneous
### Circuit Operations
YSRI circuit area is defined as within 6nm of the YSRI ARP. An aircraft operating in the circuit will be issued a clearance to the operate within the circuit area not above `A015`.

### Circuit Direction
| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 10     | Left  |
| 28     | Left |

### Start Approval
A start approval is required whenever parachute drops are conducted onto the Richmond Drop Zone. Additionally, ‘propellers/engines stopped’ reports are required. ATC shall notify these requirements by ATIS broadcast.

### Inital and Pitch
The standard inital points are 5nm downwind of the active runway, dead side, left pitch/circuit.

## Coordination
### RIC TCU

'Next' coordination is required from RIC ADC to SY TCU for all aircraft.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**RIC ADC** -> **SY TCU**</span>: "Next, TROJ57, runway 28"  
    <span class="hotline">**SY TCU** -> **RIC ADC**</span>: "TROJ57, unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**RIC ADC** -> **SY TCU**</span>: "TROJ57"  

### Level Assignment
The Standard Assignable Level from  **RIC ADC** to **SY TCU** is:  
a) The Lower of `A050` or `RFL` for Aircraft assigned via Procedural or RNAV SID.
