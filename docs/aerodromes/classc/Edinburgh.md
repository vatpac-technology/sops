## Airspace

- **EDN ADC Airspace**: `SFC` to `A015` within the Edinburgh Control Zone (ED CTR).

## Runway Modes
Single runway operations only.

## Circuit Procedures

The Edinburgh Circuit Area (EDN CIRA) is active at all times when the Edinburgh CTR is active.

Circuit operations occur within the CTR bounded by the Gawler River to the north and the powerline running from the Gawler River (1.5NM south of the Gawler Township) to the south eastern boundary of the ED CTR. Vertical Limits `SFC` to `A020`

If Parafield RWY 03L is active, it can infringe on the circuit deadside. VFR traffic in the EDN CIRA is instructed to remain on the west of the RWY centreline.

!!! phraseology
    **EDN ADC**: "CIVIL TRANSIT IN PROGRESS, DEAD-SIDE NOT AVAILABLE"

### Circuit Heights
| Type    | Normal Altitude |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Non Jet | A015            |
| Jet     | A020            |


### Circuit Direction

| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | --------- |
| 18     | Left      |
| 36     | Left      |

## Coordination

### Departures

- Autorelease is not in effect. Coordination for "Next" is required required for departures. They must not be issued a takeoff clearance until a release has been obtained.
- Standard assignable level: `A050` (or `RFL` if lower).
!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**ED ADC** -> **AD TCU**</span>: "Next, SGE"
    <span class="hotline">**AD TCU** -> **ED ADC**</span>: "SGE, unrestricted"

### Arrivals/Overfliers

AD TCU must coordinate the sequence information to EDN ADC.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**AD TCU** -> **ED ADC**</span>: "To the west, PLE, for the ILS-Z"
    <span class="hotline">**ED ADC** -> **AD TCU**</span>: "PLE, ILS-Y"

- AD TCU will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to EDN ADC.
- **IFR arrivals** will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to ED ADC, unless ED ADC nominates a restriction.
- **VFR arrivals** will be cleared for the coordinated visual approach prior to handoff to ED ADC, unless ED ADC nominates a restriction.

## Helicopter Operations
- **HLS Locations**: The HLS is located on TWY D immediately east of OLA 11. There are no SIDs associated with the HLS; aircraft requiring an instrument departure can expect to depart from the runway.
