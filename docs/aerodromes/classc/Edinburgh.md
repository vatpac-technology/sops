## Airsapce

ED ADC owns the Class C airspace **in the ED CTR** within 5nm of the YPED ARP from `SFC` to `A015`. This airspace is primarily used for military circuits and initial and pitch approaches.

#### Coded Departures
Visual Departures are assigned to all military aircraft departing Edinburgh, this is through coded departures e.g (North 1) which can be found in the AD2 Sups Page for YPED. These coded departures provide a corridor with altitude constraints to join the Military Training Areas north and south of Adelaide, avoiding civilian traffic inbound to Adelaide.  

  ### Level Assignment
The Standard Assignable Level from  **ED ADC** to **ED TCU** is:  
a) `A040` for Aircraft assigned a Coded Departure.

!!! phraseology
    BLKT21 plans to enter M201 for Military Training.
    **ED ADC**: "BLKT21, cleared to YPED via AD, flight planned route. Runway 18, North 1 Departure. Climb to `A040`. Squawk 3601, Departure Frequency 128.60"  

!!! note
    Since the Coded Departures are not SIDs, AMB ACD needs to write the name of the coded departure in the Global Ops Field of the FDR and amend the flight plan route to include all relevant tracking points.

#### Miscellaneous
### Circuit Operations 
The Circuit Area Airspace is allocated to be within 5nm of the YPED ARP from `SFC` to `A015`. Aircraft can be instructed to extend outside of this airspace by ATC for traffic management. PC21 have curcuit altitude of A020 while P8s are assigned A015

### Circuit Direction
| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 18 | Left |
| 36 | Right |

### Initial and Pitch Procedures 
Aircraft will be pitching to the west in order not to impede on Class G boundary, the intail point is 2NM for RWY36 and 4NM for RWY18 along the extended centreline of taxiway E.

!!! note
    The intial point for RWY36 is close to the Class G boundary, as such ensure they are remaining inside of the airspace.
## Coordination
### AD TCU
Aircraft departing YPED in to AD TCU Class C will be coordinated from **EDN ADC** at Taxi.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="coldline">**ED ADC** -> **AD TCU**</span>: "Taxi, BLKT11 for YMES, via VIRAT"  
    <span class="coldline">**AD TCU** -> **ED ADC**</span>: "BLKT11"  

When the aircraft is ready for takeoff, **EDN ADC** will give a "Next" call, where AD TCU will provide the cleared level.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**ED ADC** -> **AD TCU**</span>: "Next, BLKT11, runway 18"  
    <span class="hotline">**AD TCU** -> **ED ADC**</span>: "BLKT11, A050"  
    <span class="hotline">**ED ADC** -> **AD TCU**</span>: "A050, BLKT11"
