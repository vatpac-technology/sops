Refer to [Class D Tower Skills](../../controller-skills/classdtwr) for more information.

## Surveillance
MK ADC is permitted to use Surveillance standards for separation. Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the MK CTR.  
For simulation purposes, visual separation is assumed to exist below the cloud base, and within 5nm. Visual separation can still be used to separate from aircraft on an instrument approach, below the cloud base.
## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. MK ADC must inform KEN(SWY) if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MK ADC** -> **MKA**</span>: "Next, TFX113"  
    <span class="hotline">**MKA** -> **MK ADC**</span>: "TFX113, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**MK ADC** -> **MKA**</span>: "TFX113"

The Standard Assignable level from MK ADC to MKA is the lower of `A060` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
MKA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers from Class C to MK ADC. Aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach prior to handoff to MK ADC, unless MK ADC nominates a restriction.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MKA** -> **MK ADC**</span>: "Via BAVAM for the RNP RWY 32, VOZ1164‚Äù  
    <span class="hotline">**MK ADC** -> **MKA**</span>: "VOZ1164, RNP RWY 32"
