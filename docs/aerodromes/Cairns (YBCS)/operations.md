In the absence of an ACD controller, SMC shall asssume the ACD responsibilities.  
In the absence of an SMC controller, ADC shall assume the SMC and ACD responsibilities.

## Taxiway Restrictions
Taxiway’s A2 and A between A2 and A3 are not available to Aircraft above 7,000 kilograms. Taxiway A4 is not available to Aircraft above 90,000 kilograms. Taxiway Y is not available to aircraft above 10,000 kilograms.

### Trinity Release

**Daytime Hours Only**

No coordination is required through Trinity Airspace for arriving aircraft in the sector Runway 15/33 extended centreline south clockwise CS 360R.  

Departing aircraft shall be transferred to TCU after ADC no longer has separation requirements.

## Runway Selection

The preferred Runway direction is Runway 15 

## Separation

### Reciprocal Runway Operations

Prior to issuing departure instructions and until the departing aircraft is airborne and another method of separation is applied, APP shall ensure that the arriving aircraft is:  
a) assigned a level above and vertically separated from the assigned level of the departure and be at a distance which permits uninterrupted profile descent without loss of radar separation;  
b) be confined to a square base leg to join not less than a 10 mile final; or  
c) confined to a procedurally separated clearance  

The above does not apply if tower accepts responsibility for separation.

!!! Note
    The ADC may not accept responsibility for separation when a jet aircraft is departing Runway 33.

### ADC Separation Responsibility

When weather conditions are suitable, ADC shall visually separate:  
a) Left downwind with straight-in final for Runway 15 within 5 Miles;  
b) Right downwind with final for runway 33 within 5 Miles:  
c) Right circuit for Runway 33  
d) Aircraft departing to the Western VFR Corridor from all arriving aircrafton or east of the extended centreline until the aircraft is established in the Corridor.

!!! Note 
    ADC shall advise TCU when this separation cannot be applied

## Departures

### IFR Departures

IFR aircraft shall be processed via one of the following SIDs:

a) RWY 15, Jets via SWIFT: SWIFT SID. Non-Jets via NONUM: NONUM
SID
b) RWY 33, All Jets: EAZEE SID, Radar Transition
c) All others: Cairns SID(R)

!!! Note
    Non-jet aircraft may be issued a Visual Departure.

### Assignable Heading Range

| Runway | Heading |
| ----------------- | ---------------|
| 15                | 350° to 030°   |
| 33                | 330° to 070° |

### Minimum IMC Levels
2.2.1.4 Lowest assignable level in IMC for assigned heading is:
Runway Jet Non-Jet

| Runway | Jet | Non-Jet|
| ------ | -------- | -------|
| 15     | **A030** | **A020,** between 350° to 030° |
| 33     | **A040,** between 330° to 009°.  **A030,** all other headings | **A040,** between 330° to 009°.  **A020,** between 010° to 060°.  **A024,** between 061° to 070° |

## VFR Operations

### Western VFR Corridor

Clearances for aircraft entering the CTR must be worded so as to leave no possibility for misinterpretation by the pilot.

!!! Example
    **NDR** -> **CS ADC**: "Cairns Tower, NDR, Edmonton, A015, for the Western VFR Corridor, Request Clearance"  
    **CS ADC** -> **NDR**: "NDR, enter the CTR tracking via the Western VFR corridor at A015. Remain on the corridor until advised."    
    `AIP GEN 3.4`

If a clearance limit is associated with the clearance, then it must be reiterated to the pilot to remain “on or west of the VFR Corridor”

!!! Example
    **NDR** -> **CS ADC**: "Cairns Tower, NDR, Edmonton, A015, for the Western VFR Corridor, Request Clearance"  
    **CS ADC** -> **NDR**: "NDR, enter the CTR tracking via the Western VFR Corridor at A015. Clearance limit the Admirty Island, Remain on or west of the Western VFR Corridor at all times."  
    `AIP GEN 3.4`

### Inbound

ACFT planning to enter the CS CTR BTN: Mt Gorton, Cape Grafton and Upolo Cay at 500FT, must contact CS TWR for airways clearance

!!! Example
    **NDR** -> **CS ADC**: "Cairns Tower, NDR, Cape Grafton, A005, Inbound, Information Alpha, Request Clearance"  
    **CS ADC** -> **NDR**: "NDR, enter the CTR tracking for a Right Base runway 33, A005."  
    `AIP GEN 3.4`

### Circuit Direction

| Runway | Direction |
| ----------------- | ---------------|
| 15                | Left  |
| 33                | Right |

## ATIS
### Approach Types

**Approach Expectation shall be `Expect Instrument Approach` when:**

| Time           | Runway 15     | Runway 33                             |
| ------| -------------- | -------------------------------------|
| Day   | Conditions do not meet requirements for CS 360-R Creek Corridor Procedure – NAP2 (VMC conditions do not exist below 3,000 FT)        | Conditions do not meet the requirements for KEEWI arrival visual procedure (VMC conditions do not exist below 3,000 FT) |
| Night | All conditions        | All conditions |
