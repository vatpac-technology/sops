# ATIS
## Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals  | Departures |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 1 - SODPROPS    | 34L       | 16L        |
| 2 - 34 PROPS    | 34L & 34R | 34L & 34R  |
| 2 - 16 PROPS    | 16L & 16R | 16L & 16R  |
| 3 - 16D/07A     | 07        | 16L & 16R  |
| 3 - 25D/34A     | 34L & 34R | 25         |
| 4 - 16D/25A     | 25        | 16L & 16R  |
| 5 - 07          | 07        | 07         |
| 5 - 25          | 25        | 25         |
| *Curfew         | 34L       | 16R        |

*Permitted between the hours of 2300 and 0600 Local. If the pilot does not want to participate in curfew mode operations, the controller must accommodate this request

#### PROPS Runway Selection
Unless operationally required, aircraft shall be assigned the following runways for departure:

| Aircraft tracking | Runway  |
| ----------------| --------- |
| via KADOM   | 16R/34L      |
| via WOL | 16R/34L |
| via RIC| 16R/34L |
| via ENTRA | 16L/34R |
| Aircraft assigned Radar SID or No SID: |
| To the NORTH and EAST | 16L/34R |
| To the WEST and SOUTH | 16R/34L |

!!! information
    When parallel runways are used (excluding SODPROPS), the ATIS shall include: `PARALLEL RUNWAY OPERATIONS IN PROGRESS`. When parallel runways are used for departures, the ATIS shall include: `INDEPENDENT DEPARTURES IN PROGRESS`.

### Approach Type

| Cloud Base             | Visibility     | Approach                             |
| -----------------------| -------------- | -------------------------------------|
| >3000FT                | >5000M         | `EXPECT INDEPENDENT VISUAL APPROACH` |
| Between 2000FT & 3000FT| >5000M         | `EXPECT ILS APPROACH THEN INDEPENDENT VISUAL APPROACH WHEN VISUAL`|
| Below 2000FT         or| <5000M         | `EXPECT ILS APPROACH`                |

### Standard Taxi Routes

Except when the traffic situation warrants, taxi clearances shall conform to the following diagram:
(2.1.4.1 Diagram)
#### Standard Assignable Levels - Departure

Jets: `A050`
Non-jets: `A030`

#### Runway Assignment

Take in to account an aircraft's weight when Runway 16L/34R or 07/25 are in use. The aircraft may operationally require the longer Runway 16R/34L. If in doubt, ask the pilot.

## Airspace

Tower airspace is defined as between SFC to 500 FT, within the lateral limits:
a) Wanda Kopter Route; then
b) along the SY CTR boundary; to
c) Long Bay; then
d) direct to YSSY.
