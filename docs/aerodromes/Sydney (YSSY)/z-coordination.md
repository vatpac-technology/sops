### Auto Release

"Next" Coordination to SY TCU is not required for aircraft assigned a **Procedural SID** and the Standard Assignable Level (link). Aircraft that have been assigned the **Radar SID** must be assigned a heading on departure. “Next” coordination is not required to the SY TCU controller when the departing aircraft has been assigned the standard assignable level, and has been cleared via any of the headings listed below:

| Runway | Jet | Non-Jet 
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 07                | 070         | 020, 110       |
| 16L                | 125          | 090* |
| 16R               | 170         | 210         |
| 25                | 300, 240          | 020, 210, 240 |
| 34L                | 290          | 230 |
| 34R                | 030-070          | 350 |
|*Not permitted when RWY 25 is also in use|

!!! information
    Where multiple standard assignable headings are available, assign the heading most suitable for the aircraft's direction of flight

"Next" Coordination to SY TCU is additionally required for:
    a) Departures to YSBK
    b) Jets departing 16L via WOL, except during SODPROPS
    c) after a go-around, the next departure from that runway

Either the SY TWR or SY TCU controller can suspend/resume Auto Release at any time, provided it is coordinated to the other controller
