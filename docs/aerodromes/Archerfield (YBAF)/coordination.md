## BK SMC / SY TCU

### Taxi Call

Whilst the aircraft is taxiing, the Ground Controller will Coordinate with the relevant Brisbane TCU position.
Brisbane TCU will;
  a. Issue an airways clearance for Archerfield Tower to relay to the aircraft;
  b. Clear the aircraft to A040, where the aircraft's RFL is above A040; and
  
!!! example
    **BK SMC** -> **SY TCU**: "Taxi's, XMM, Bankstown, 10L”  
    **SY TCU** -> **BK SMC**: “XMM, Cleared to Bankstown via HUUGO Flight Planned Route, Archerfield 3 Departure, Climb via SID A040, Squawk 1427”  
    **BK SMC** -> **SY TCU**: “Cleared to Bankstown via HUUGO Flight Planned Route, Archerfield 3 Departure, Climb via SID A040, Squawk 1427, XMM”  


## BK ADC / SY TCU

### Next Call

Tower will now coordinate with the relevant Class C sector above them for permission to release the aircraft into their CTA.

!!! example
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: "Next, XMM, 10L”  
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “XMM, Unrestricted"

!!! information
    Keep in mind some Class D aerodromes only allow 1 IFR aircraft in the CTR at any one time so Approach Centre Controllers will either approve or deny the release of the aircraft until a seperation standard is available for them.

Once the aircraft is clear of the Class D CTR either vertically or laterally the tower controller will tell them to contact the relevant frequency. 

## SY TCU / BK TWR

### Arrival Coordination

BN TCU will coordinate with AF ADC for incoming IFR arrivals on either Visual Tracking or RNP approaches.
If tracking visually, BN TCU must coordinate the level assignment with the estimate for aircraft arriving directly from Class C.
Archerfield Tower will not alter an aircrafts tracking until the aircraft is within 3NM of Archerfield.



#### Visual Tracking

!!! example
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Estimate, UJN via TWRN time 02.”  
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: “UJN” 

#### IAP Tracking

!!! example
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Estimated Approach Time, UJN via RNP at time 59”  
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: “via RNP, UJN”   
    **BK Tower Must Clear Aircraft for Final, before SY TCU issues approach clearance.**  
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Request clearance for final, UJN”  
    **BK ADC** -> **SY TCU**: “UJN Cleared RNP 11C” 
    **SY TCU** -> **BK ADC**: “Cleared RNP 11C, UJN”  

## SDS / SY TCU

### Miscellaneous

If departure is Runway 11 into CTA, coordination is required with Director (or SDS) if open, as the "Half a Radar Sep Standard From Sector Boundary" rule.

!!! Example
    **SDS** -> **SY TCU**: “Request left turn our of Bankstown”  
    **SY TCU** -> **SDS**: "Approved" (no callsigns need be used here)  

## Standard Assignable Departure Levels

All IFR Aircraft: `A030`
