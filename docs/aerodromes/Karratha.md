## Surveillance
KA ADC is permitted to use Surveillance standards for separation. Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the KA CTR.  
For simulation purposes, visual separation is assumed to exist below the cloud base, and within 5nm. Visual separation can still be used to separate from aircraft on an instrument approach, below the cloud base.
## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. KA ADC must inform OLW if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**KA ADC** -> **OLW**</span>: "Next, NWK694"  
    <span class="hotline">**OLW** -> **KA ADC**</span>: "NWK694"  

The Standard Assignable level from KA ADC to OLW is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
### Arrivals
OLW will coordinate the sequence to KA ADC.

!!! example
    <span class="coldline">**OLW** -> **KA ADC**</span>: "New Sequence of 2. Via PD, FD630J, Number 1. Via PKAEC for the RNAV Z RWY 26, VOZ1729, Number 2‚Äù  
    <span class="coldline">**KA ADC** -> **OLW**</span>: "FD630J, Number 1. VOZ1729, Number 2"  

The Standard Assignable level from OLW to KA ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
