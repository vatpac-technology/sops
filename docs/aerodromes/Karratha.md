## Surveillance
Surveillance coverage can be expected to be available at all levels in the KA CTR. Although KA ADC is **not permitted** to use surveillance for separation, OLW may assist by establishing surveillance separation standards via coordination

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. KA ADC must inform OLW if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**KA ADC** -> **OLW**</span>: "Next, NWK694"  
    <span class="hotline">**OLW** -> **KA ADC**</span>: "NWK694, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**KA ADC** -> **OLW**</span>: "NWK694"

The Standard Assignable level from KA ADC to OLW is the lower of `A050` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
### Arrivals/Overfliers
OLW will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to KA ADC

!!! example
    <span class="coldline">**OLW** -> **KA ADC**</span>: "Via PD, KPG, Overflier”  
    <span class="coldline">**KA ADC** -> **OLW**</span>: "KPG, A040"  

The Standard Assignable level from OLW to KA ADC is `A060`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
