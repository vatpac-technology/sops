## Runway Modes
If winds are too great, single runway operations may be necessary (eg, Runway 16 for Arrivals and Departures). However, pending wind limitations (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), the following runway modes are to be used

| Mode | Arrivals  | Departures |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 27AD/34D   | 27       | 34 (Departures NE), 27 (All other deps)        |
| 16A/27D    | 16 | 27  |

!!! information
    "Departures NE" means departures via MNG, NONIX and DOSEL. Runway 34 for departure may also be more suitable during this runway mode for heavy aircraft, and aircraft taxiing from the southern apron.

#### SID Selection

Jet Aircraft planned via **MNG**, **NONIX**, **DOSEL**, **CORRS**, **KEPPA**, **NEVIS**, **SUNTI**, **ESDIG**, or **CRENA**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

!!! example
    Jet Aircraft planned via DOSEL, assigned runway 27, shall be given DOSEL1 departure.

Non-Jet Aircraft, and aircraft that cannot accept a Procedural SID, shall be assigned the **Radar SID**.

## ATIS

#### ATIS Identifier
YMML ATIS identifiers only uses letters `N` through to `Y`, due to YMEN using letters `A` through `M`
