# MB TWR / ML TCU
#### Departures

Aircraft departing YMMB in to ML TCU Class C will be coordinated to the relevant ML TCU controller at Taxi.

!!! example
    **MB TWR** -> **ML TCU**: "Taxi, SGE for YBLT via ML"  
    **ML TCU** -> **MB TWR**: "SGE for YBLT via ML, Squawk 3601"  
    **MB TWR** -> **ML TCU**: "3601, SGE"

All IFR departures in to ML TCU airspace (Class C and G), require a "Next" call to ML TCU, where ML TCU will provide the cleared level.

!!! example
    **MB TWR** -> **ML TCU**: "Next, SGE"  
    **ML TCU** -> **MB TWR**: "SGE, A060"  
    **MB TWR** -> **ML TCU**: "A060, SGE"

!!! note
    ML TCU will not receive a taxi call on aircraft departing in to Class G airspace, including aircraft that have planned to leave and re-enter controlled airspace (for example, aircraft planned at or above A050 on the MB-AV track). In this instance, ML TCU is only required to readback the callsign at the "Next" call. ML TCU will then give airways clearance to the aircraft on first contact if required.
#### Arrivals
ML TCU will coordinate the sequence information to **MB TWR** prior to transfer of jurisdiction.

!!! example
    **ML TCU** -> **MB TWR**: "OXA, via MMBSA, Number 1"  
    **MB TWR** -> **ML TCU**: "OXA, Number 1"
