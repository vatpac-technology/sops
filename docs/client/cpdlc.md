title: CPDLC

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

In the real world, CPDLC operations are generally used by aircraft within airspaces in Class A airspace above `F245`.

CPDLC Functionality may also be used by pilots to request a PDC.    
PDC's utilising vatACARS are initiated by the pilot, however, the standalone vatSys functionality can be used in lieu of vatACARS without a pilot initated request.

!!! Note
    **CPDLC in it's enroute capacity should only be used by Enroute (C1) controllers or above.**

    PDC's may be issued using the vatACARS Client by any controller.

## Setup

The vatACARS client can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://vatacars.com/){target=new}.  

The vatACARS client requires controllers to have a [Hoppies ACARS](https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html){target=new} account and logon code, plus a [vatACARS Token](https://vatacars.com/me){target=new}.

If the client is installed correctly, there will be an *ACARS* drop-down box available.

## Pre Departure Clearance

To utilise vatACARS for issuing PDC's, the controller must be logged into a VATPAC TCU, ADC, SMC or ACD position.

!!! Note
    If multiple controllers are present at one airport, the controller responsible for the ACD position will manage PDCs through vatACARS.

After logging onto the VATSIM network, the controller should open the *Setup* window, fill in the relevent details, and click *Connect*

<figure markdown>
![vatACARS Setup](../controller-skills/img/vatacarslogon.png){ width="700" }
</figure>

**Station Code:** Must be the identifier of the position which is being controlled.          
**vatACARS Token:** Must be your unique vatACARS Token, found [here](https://vatacars.com/me){target=new}.          
**Logon Code:** Must be your [Hoppies ACARS](https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html){target=new} Code.            

Controllers **MUST** note in their controller remarks section that PDC's are available in the format below.

Once connected and with CPDLC enabled, pilots will connect to the vatACARS plugin via their aircraft's CPDLC system. The controller will normally receive a *'Request PDC'* message through vatACARS. The controller should left-click the received message to issue the PDC. A self-explanatory window will appear, fill in the *DEP FREQ* and, if required, *FREE TEXT* field and send this back to the aircraft. Note that the pilot's strip **MUST** be filled out in order to issue a PDC through vatACARS. Once the aircraft has received their PDC, the pilot will usually respond with *'Roger'* or similar to show they have received the clearance.

!!! Note
    If providing a Top-Down service as an enroute position, the pilots will be required to connect to the your Enroute Station Code. Eg: YISA, etc

## Enroute

To utilise CPDLC, the controller must be logged into a VATPAC Enroute or Oceanic Position.

**CPDLC (Except for PDC's) must not be used below `F245`.**

After logging onto the VATSIM network, the controller should open the *Setup* window, fill in the relevent details and click *Connect*

**Station Code:** Must be the identifier of the position which is being controlled.          
**vatACARS Token:** Must be your unique vatACARS Token, found [here](https://vatacars.com/me){target=new}.          
**Logon Code:** Must be your [Hoppies ACARS](https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html){target=new} Code.            

Controllers **MUST** note in their controller remarks section that CPDLC is available in the format below.

Some major Enroute positions do not use CPDLC as a primary means of communication, however, controllers may use CPDLC in lieu of voice when applicable.

### Station Codes

| Position | Station Code | Primary Communication Method |
| --- | ---- | ----- |
| ARL | YARL | Voice |
| HWE | YHWE | **CPDLC** |
| INL | YINL | Voice |
| ISA | YISA | **CPDLC** |
| KEN | YKEN | Voice |
| TRT | YTRT | **CPDLC** |
| ASP | YASP | **CPDLC** |
| BIK | YBIK | Voice |
| ELW | YELW | Voice |
| HUO | YHUO | Voice |
| OLW | YOLW | **CPDLC** |
| PIY | YPIY | Voice |
| TBD | YTBD | Voice |
| YWE | YYWE | Voice |
| TSN | YTSN | **CPDLC** |
| FLD | YFLD | **CPDLC** |
| IND | YIND | **CPDLC** |
| NFFF | NFFF | **CPDLC** |
| NZZO | NZZO | **CPDLC** |
| KZAK | KZAK | **CPDLC** |

!!! Note
    If a non-standard subsector is online, the Station Code will be required to change to match the controlled subsector.

### Accepting an Aircraft

Once connected and with CPDLC enabled, pilots will connect to the vatACARS plugin via their aircraft's CPDLC system. The controller will normally recieve a *'Logon Request'* message through vatACARS.         
The controller should left click their callsign to respond to this initial message, and respond with a *'Accept Logon'*  to show the pilot that they have successfully connected. 

<figure markdown>

</figure>

This aircraft will now be automatically added to your Dispatch window to allow a controller ulilise their CPDLC.

### Message Editor

When either a pilot sends a request or ATC requires to send a message to the pilot, left clicking the callsign in the dispatch window will open the message editor.         
This is used to select from a group of relevant messages to send back to the pilot.   

<figure markdown>
![vatACARS Setup](../controller-skills/img/vatacarseditor2.png){ width="700" }
</figure>

If the response to the pilot is not shown in this initial dispatch window, the controller should click the *Edit* button, this will bring the controller to a broarder range of messages to send to the pilot.

<figure markdown>
![vatACARS Setup](../controller-skills/img/vatacarseditor1.png){ width="700" }
</figure>

Left clicking the number next to the text box will change the line of text forward up to 5 different lines, Right clicking the number will go to the previous line. 

### Handing over Aircraft

#### ENR/OCN

When transferring between Enroute or Oceanic sectors, ATC will right click on the aircraft which will bring up a handover window. The controller should select the next ATC unit the aircraft is going, this will transfer the aircraft through CPDLC to the next ATC unit.

</figure>

#### ENR/TCU

Standard Voice frequency transfers must be used for aircraft below `F245` and between ENR to TCU Positions. 

### Terminating CPDLC

If CPDLC is no longer available or required, ATC will right-click on the aircraft, which will bring up the option to log the aircraft off. By clicking *'LOGOFF'*, the aircraft will be sent a Logoff message.
