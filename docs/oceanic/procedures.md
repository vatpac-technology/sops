## Transition Altitudes

| Name  | 	Transition Altitude  | 	Transition Level   |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| KZAK - Oakland Oceanic |  18,000ft | FL180 |
| YBBB - Brisbane Oceanic  | 10,000ft  | FL110  | 
| AGGG - Honiara FIR	 |  11,000ft	 |  FL120 | 
| ANAU - Nauru FIR |  11,000ft	 |  FL120 |  
| YMMM - Melbourne Oceanic |  10,000ft | FL110  | 
| NZZO - Auckland Oceanic  |  13,000ft |  FL150 |  
| NZCM - McMurdo Oceanic  |  19,500ft |  FL200 |
| NFFF - Nadi Oceanic  | 11,000ft  |  FL130 | 
| NTTT - Tahiti Oceanic  |  9,000ft |  By ATC |

!!! Note 
    Standard Altimeter setting (29.92 inHg/1013 hPa) should be used when more than 100 nm from McMurdo.

!!! note
    Auckland Oceanic airspace does not have a transition layer, except within the Rarotonga, Samoa and Norfolk Island QNH zones.  
    
    Aircraft within Auckland Oceanic airspace should use the standard altimeter setting of 1013 hPa unless within the aforementioned QNH zones.

!!! tip
    Remember that some cruising levels above the transition level are unavailable when the Area QNH is below 1013.  Refer to `AIP ENR 1.7` for more information.

## HF Radio
Simulated HF radio is used as the primary long-range radio communications medium. The nature of HF radio makes it highly vulnerable to atmospheric distortion and noise, and so radiotelephony (R/T) procedures on HF tend to be more formal in order to maximise clarity.

!!! Example
    **UAL873**: "San Francisco Radio, San Francisco Radio, UAL873 on 122.5"  
    **ZAK_FSS**: "UAL873, San Francisco Radio, go-ahead"  
    **UAL873**: "San Francisco Radio, UAL873 request climb FL390"

## SELCAL
Given the background noise level experienced on HF radio frequencies, flight crews usually prefer to turn down the audio level of their HF receiver. SELCAL uses a unique 4-letter code for each aircraft (eg. QR-AC) transmitted over the communications frequency to sound an alert for the flight crew.

Controllers must check each aircraft’s flight plan for a discrete SELCAL code. If aircraft have nominated a discrete code (for example `QR-AC`), then a SELCAL Check shall be completed.

!!! Example
    **TSN**: "ANZ254, standby SELCAL check."  
    *The aircraft awaits the SELCAL check before replying.*  
    **ANZ254**: "SELCAL check OK, ANZ254."  
    **TSN**: "ANZ254, report estimate BOTGU."  

After the SELCAL check has been completed, controllers must preface all communications to that aircraft with a SELCAL prompt.

## Position Reports
A Position Report will contain the following elements:  
- Callsign  
- Position & Time  
- Flight level  
- Next position and time over   
- Ensuing significant point   
- Specified Speed (if assigned)

!!! Note
    If after making a position report an estimate has changed by more than 2 minutes, the new estimate shall be passed to ATC.  

If an aircraft fails to report its position within 3 minutes of its estimated time, controllers must attempt to establish contact with that aircraft and obtain a position report.

ATC shall acknowledge a position report by using the aircraft's callsign. A readback of the report is not required.

!!! Example
    **UAL873**: "San Francisco Radio, San Francisco Radio, UAL873 Position"  
    **ZAK_FSS**: "UAL873, San Francisco Radio"  
    **UAL873**: "UAL873 position LHI time 1853, FL360, estimate PANDA at 1953, SANDO next. Maintaining Mach 0.84”  
    **ZAK_FSS**: "UAL873, San Francisco Radio, Copied Position" 
    
## Simulator Time Compression
Due to the length of most oceanic crossings, some pilots may elect to use time compression to speed up their cruise segment.  Controllers should accommodate this request where possible.

!!! note
    Time compression is not available within **20 minutes** of a domestic sector.

Aircraft using time compression must be assigned the following levels for separation with other traffic:  

| Sim Rate | Eastbound  | Westbound |
| ----------------| --------- | -------- |
| 2x   | FL390     | FL380 |
| 4x | FL410 | FL400 |

!!! important
    Aircraft at normal speed **always** have priority over aircraft using Time Compression.

## STAR Clearance Expectation

### Handoff
Aircraft being transferred to the following sectors shall be told to Expect STAR Clearance on handoff:

| Transferring Sector | Receiving Sector | ADES | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| IND | PIY(LEA) | YPPH | |
| TSN | ARL(OCN) | YSSY | |
| FLD | INL(SDY) | YBBN, YBCG, YBSU | |
| TSN | HUO | YMHB | |

## Coordination
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.
