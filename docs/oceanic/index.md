- A permitted controller who does not meet the hour requirement specified above, will be considered inactive; and
- An inactive permitted controller may become active again, by performing a buddy session with a permitted controller who is approved to do so by that PO; and
- Any additional currency or activity requirements imposed by a PO on local or visiting controllers do not apply to permitted controllers.
