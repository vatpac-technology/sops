## Seperation Standards

### Longitudinal

<figure markdown>
![Oceanic](assets/Oceanic.png)
</figure>

Longitudinal separation shall only be applied between aircraft on same or reciprocal tracks. There is an exception to this rule where a 15 minute standard may be used for crossing tracks.  

Longitudinal time separation must be established by using pilot estimates and ensuring that the time between two aircraft is equal or greater than the longitudinal time separation minimum.  

!!! Example
    "ABC, Cross ALPHA at time 1051 or later"  
    "DEF, Hold at BRAVO to leave BRAVO at time 2215 or later"


### Same Track
Aircraft that are on the same track, including situations where one aircraft is climbing or descending through the level of another, are to be separated by **10 minutes**
<figure markdown>
![10min](assets/10min.png)
</figure>

### Crossing Track
Aircraft that are on crossing tracks, including situations where one aircraft is climbing or descending through the level of another, are to be separated by **15 minutes** at the point of intersection
<figure markdown>
![15min](assets/15min.png)
</figure>

Where a difference 15 minutes does not exist at the crossing point, vertical separation shall be applied from the time at which the second aircraft is 15 minutes from the crossing point until the first aircraft is 15 minutes past the crossing point.

</figure>

### Reciprocal Track
Aircraft flying on reciprocal tracks may only be separated vertically. Such separation must exist **at least 10 minutes** prior to the estimated time of passing
<figure markdown>
![ETP](assets/ETP.png)
</figure>

After the estimated time of passing, aircraft may not climb or descend through the level of the opposite direction aircraft until **10 minutes** after the estimated time of passing. It is possible to reduce this requirement if definite passing has been achieved, and this will be explained later in this section.


### Distance

Distance based separation is a subset of longitudinal separation, and it is assessed and updated either by an aircraft's routine position reports, or those initiated by the controller. Between the two forms of longitudinal separation standards we have looked at so far, distance based separation often offers a more efficient use of airspace than time standards.

As an example, let's assume that we have two aircraft that are both cruising at 460kts groundspeed. In 10 minutes, these aircraft will travel approximately 77NM (4606). So, if we were to apply the 10 minute same track separation standard that we covered in the previous lesson, then there would be 77NM between the two aircraft. We'll discuss this further very shortly, but just trust us for now that the distance based standard we would apply to these aircraft is 50NM. Looking at these two measurements, it's clear that a distance based standard will let us run these aircraft closer together and maximise the use of the airspace.

However, it is important to keep in mind that different meteorological conditions and different aircraft will travel at different speeds, so sometimes it may not be more efficient to run a distance standard. It's up to you as an oceanic controller to make that call about which will provide the most efficient use of airspace. As a guide to help you decide, if the aircraft are travelling above 300kts groundspeed then it would be more efficient to use a distance standard.

#### DME
For all DME-based standards, distance reports using "off-track" navaids may be used provided that the position of both aircraft is such that both of their DME readings are either increasing or decreasing.



For aircraft on the "same track", the minimum distance standard is 20nm.


For aircraft that are climbing or descending on the "same track", 15nm may be used while vertical separation does not exist provided that one aircraft is maintaining a level while vertical separation does not exist and that separation is established by obtaining simultaneous DME readings from the aircraft.



For aircraft on "crossing tracks", a DME-based standard is not available.

For aircraft on "reciprocal tracks", aircraft utilising on-track DME may be cleared to climb or descend to or through the levels occupied by other aircraft utilising on-track DME, provided that it has been positively established that the aircraft have passed each other and are at least 10nm apart.

#### RNAV
RNAV distance-based separation may be applied between RNAV-equipped aircraft when operating on designated RNAV routes or on ATS routes defined by a VOR. RNAV-equipped aircraft operating within airspace covered by the Agreement are assumed to conform to RNP-10 (10nm Required Navigation Performance) standard, unless otherwise indicated in the flight plan. ADS is assumed to be unavailable in VATSIM airspace, and airspace covered by the Agreement is assumed to be RNP10 (rather than the real world RNP4).

RNAV RNP10 aircraft climbing, cruising or descending on the same track must be separated by at least 50nm in conjunction with the Mach Number Technique (explained later in this section), provided that:

Each aircraft reports its distance to or from the same waypoint
Separation between aircraft at the same level is checked by obtaining simultaneous RNAV distance readings from the aircraft at frequent intervals to ensure that the minimum will not be infringed
Separation between aircraft climbing or descending is established by obtaining simultaneous RNAV distance readings from the aircraft
In the case of aircraft climbing or descending, one aircraft maintains a level while vertical separation does not exist.


#### Distance Checks
When running a distance standard with no closing between aircraft, distance checks must be made no less often than every 30 minutes. When running a distance standard with closing between aircraft, distance checks must be made no later than every 15 minutes. The maximum closing speed permitted between two aircraft when running a distance standard is M.06.

"Air Canada 522 and Qantas 127, in turn, report your DME distance from Lord Howe Island"





### Definite Passing

Definite passing is a useful tool for controllers when applying longitudinal separation standards to aircraft on reciprocal tracks. Recall that we must apply vertical separation to aircraft on reciprocal tracks until they have definitely passed each other. This lesson will explain the methods that you can use to establish definite passing between aircraft. 

Aircraft are considered to have definitely passed when reports indicate any of the following:

10 DME between aircraft;
50 RNAV between aircraft; or
Passage over a positive radio fix (NDB, VOR)
When we say reports indicate passage over a positive radio fix, this means that both aircraft have reported passing the same radio navigation aid.

An alternative method to establish definite passing is to instruct pilots to "sight & pass" each other. This can be done using the following phraseology:

"Qantas 11, report sighting and passing United 812, Boeing 747, 1000ft above you, estimated time of passing 1715."

When using the sight & pass method, both aircraft must confirm they have visually sighted & passed the other aircraft. TCAS may not be used in lieu of a visual sighting.


### Mach Number Technique

The mach number technique is something that a controller can use in conjunction with a time-based standard to allow two jets to operate with closing between them. The mach number technique may only be used on the same or diverging tracks, and may only be used between jet aircraft.

The mach number technique operates on the basis that for a given amount of closing between two aircraft (‘Difference in Mach column’), a certain amount of time is required between the aircraft at the time they enter conflict. This time depends on the distance the aircraft are flying and is always greater than 10 minutes, to ensure that 10 minutes will be maintained until the aircraft exit conflict.

If assigned a mach number, pilots shall maintain that speed until ATC instructs otherwise. Due to this, we can rely on aircraft maintaining the same mach number over a long time period which is a key requirement for employing the mach number technique. The following table contains the information needed to use the technique to maintain separation over a specifed route sector/interval length:

Distance to Fly and Separation (in minutes) required at Entry Point
Difference in Mach  	0 - 600nm  	601 - 1200nm  	1201 - 1800nm  	1801 - 24000nm  	2401-3000nm
0.01	11	12	13	14	15
0.02	12	14	16	18	20
0.03	13	16	19	22	25
0.04	14	18	22	26	30
0.05	15	20	25	30	35
0.06	16	22	28	34	40
0.07	17	24	31	38	45
0.08	18	26	34	42	50
0.09	19	28	37	46	55
0.10	20	30	40	50	60
For example, let's consider two aircraft, A & B, that will be on the same track for 700nm with a closing speed of M.04. Using the table above, we see that there must be 18 minutes of separation between these aircraft at the entry point if there is to be 10 minutes of separation between them at the exit point.





### Lateral Separation

Along with longitudinal separation, lateral separation is a method of separating aircraft 'horizontally', or in other words, separating aircraft that are at the same altitude/flight level. Longitudinal separation is used to separate aircraft at a given time using their position, whereas lateral separation is something used to separate aircraft over a period of time using their heading. This might sound a little confusing at first, but once you've read this page it will hopefully start to make sense.

In procedural airspace, lateral separation is based on the possible position of an aircraft, rather than the actual position (as determined by radar). This means we must apply large tolerances to account for possible navigation equipment errors.

Unlike longitudinal separation, lateral separation does not provide any separation standards, but it is instead a tool that enables you to determine the point at which two aircraft on intersecting tracks will enter or leave lateral conflict. While aircraft are not in lateral conflict, no other separation standard needs to be applied. However, once the aircraft enter lateral conflict then you must apply either longitudinal or vertical separation (keeping in mind the track angle consideration which may preclude running a distance standard). The table below will help you to determine when an aircraft will enter and leave lateral conflict.

 Angle 	 Distance 	 Angle 	 Distance 	 Angle 	 Distance 	 Angle 	 Distance 
20	287	38	147	56	96	74	68
21	273	39	143	57	94	75	67
22	261	40	139	58	92	76	66
23	249	41	136	59	90	77	64
24	238	42	132	60	88	78	63
25	229	43	129	61	87	79	62
26	220	44	126	62	85	80	61
27	211	45	123	63	83	81	60
28	203	46	120	64	82	82	59
29	196	47	117	65	80	83	58
30	189	48	114	66	79	84	57
31	183	49	112	67	77	85	56
32	177	50	109	68	76	86	55
33	171	51	107	69	74	87	54
34	166	52	104	70	73	88	53
35	161	53	102	71	72	89	52
36	156	54	100	72	70	90	51
37	152	55	98	73	69	

The number in the Angle column represents the angular difference (in degrees) between tracks, while the number in the adjacent Distance column represents the distance (in NM) from the common point at which lateral separation exists. You must have another form of separation applied prior to the second aircraft entering lateral conflict

Example
For tracks with an angular difference of 35 degrees, aircraft enter lateral conflict at 161nm from the common point.

“UAE406, due to converging traffic at TATOD a level change is required. Climb to reach FL350 by 161nm from TATOD."





### Vertical

Vertical separation is the most common form of separation that is employed within oceanic airspace as a controller can have two aircraft flying at vertically separated levels with no risk of a loss of separation until one needs to climb or descend. Unlike longitudinal separation, there is no need to constantly monitor position reports or check in with aircraft, you can just assign vertically separated levels and know that there will be no conflict.

The primary source of aircraft altitudes and levels shall be pilot reports. This means that you cannot clear an aircraft to climb/descend into levels that were previously occupied by another aircraft until that aircraft reports clear of the levels in question.

The vertical separation standards applied in oceanic airspace are exactly the same as those in domestic airspace. They are reproduced below as a reminder. Recall that in VATPAC airspace, RVSM airspace exists between FL290 and FL410 inclusive:

1000ft in RVSM airspace where both aircraft are RVSM capable.
1000ft in non-RVSM airspace below FL290
2000ft in RVSM airspace where one or both aircraft are not RVSM capable
2000ft in non-RVSM airspace above FL410
3000ft where one or both aircraft are supersonic
