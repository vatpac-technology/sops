!!! Note 
    KZAK oceanic positions may be further subdivided by the shift supervisor, in which case the subsector shall add a numeral to the callsign. For example, ZAK_1_FSS. It is discouraged to only control a portion of KZAK in non-event periods. For more information on KZAK procedures, head to their SOPs [here.](https://oakartcc.org/web/viewer.html?file=/controllers/file/e8a98e09-1c16-11ec-9430-2a32edb55910){target=new}

!!! note
    The AGGG and ANAU FIRs do not have their own distinct positions or frequencies, they are part of the COL subsector in the FLD group.

- A permitted controller who does not meet the hour requirement specified above, will be considered inactive; and
- An inactive permitted controller may become active again, by performing a buddy session with a permitted controller who is approved to do so by that PO; and
- Any additional currency or activity requirements imposed by a PO on local or visiting controllers do not apply to permitted controllers.
